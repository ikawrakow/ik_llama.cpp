## 📄 Description

### What happened?

I'm a bit of a newbie here, and apologies if I'm doing something wrong.

I'm currently compiling llama.cpp and running with llama-swap, and all is well. I decided to give this fork a try alongside my current setup.

I can compile ik_llama, but when I go to run llama-cli or llama-server (even to just get the current version), I get this error: 

`/root/llama-builds/ik_llama.cpp/bin/llama-server: undefined symbol: llama_set_offload_policy`

Build flags:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$INSTALL_DIR" \
    -DGGML_CCACHE=OFF \
    -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=FLAME \
    -DGGML_VULKAN=ON
```

These are similar to my llama.cpp build, but that uses HIP/ROCm instead of Vulkan. (note I have tried this both with Vulkan ON and OFF with same result).

I do see these warnings in the build logs:

```bash

...but that's all that stands out to me.

It looks like a confusion between `llama.cpp` and `ik_llama.cpp` libraries. I suspect `llama.cpp` is installed system-wide, so when the `ik_llama.cpp` server is started it picks up the `llama.cpp` DLLs. 

This project does not consider the possibility of co-existing with a system-wide installation of `llama.cpp`. The work around is to use `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, e.g.,
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/root/llama-builds/ik_llama.cpp/bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
/root/llama-builds/ik_llama.cpp/bin/llama-server ...
```

Yep, that was root cause. I've been restructuring my llama environment to use local, static builds of both `llama.cpp` and `ik_llama.cpp` this morning using `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF` and now they're both working great.
Thanks for all your hard work!
