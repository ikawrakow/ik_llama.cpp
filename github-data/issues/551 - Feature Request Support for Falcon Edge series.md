## 📄 Description

### Prerequisites

- [x] I am running the latest code. Mention the version if possible as well.
- [x] I carefully followed the [README.md](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/README.md).
- [x] I searched using keywords relevant to my issue to make sure that I am creating a new issue that is not already open (or closed).
- [x] I reviewed the [Discussions](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions), and have a new and useful enhancement to share.

### Feature Description

Falcon Edge series: https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-edge-series-6804fd13344d6d8a8fa71130

The Falcon Edge series as released around the same time as Microsoft's [bitnet](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T) model.


### Motivation

I think for people who need a small, speedy, and performant model in a resource constrained environment this would make a great addition. 

### Possible Implementation

_No response_

Is it supported in mainline `llama.cpp`?

It seems like support exists in `bitnet.cpp` (which is even better considering they forked around when we did). 

This is their submodule update for it: https://github.com/Eddie-Wang1120/llama.cpp/compare/5eb47b72106e3b35f10e8befa616a9241242b226...40ed0f290203a9a78540b8f7eb18bd828043fe21. 
This is the PR adding support containing that submodule update and the convert python code: https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet/pull/268/files#diff-f90cdc9c8f0e8eefed785548f9fac0bd8868cf4430e259cef59b5833ca299c4c.

Support seems rather easy to add.

I read the blogpost, and I agree. They trained on less tokens (1.5 T vs 4T) but they still ended up with strong models for their size, even compared to `Bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T`.

In that case it should (almost) work:
```
huggingface-cli download --local-dir falcon tiiuae/Falcon-E-3B-Instruct-GGUF
./bin/llama-quantize --allow-requantize falcon/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf test.gguf iq2_bn
./bin/llama-cli -m test.gguf -c 8192 -s 5678 -n 128 -p "I believe the meaning of life is" -t 16
```
The last command fails with 
```
llama_model_load: error loading model: error loading model vocabulary: unknown pre-tokenizer type: 'falcon_e'
```
So, I guess, it is a matter of adding this `falcon-e` pre-tokenizer? Or are there differences in the architecture?

Yep, the linked code shows just that and adding a template. Like I said support seems rather easy.

>Or are there differences in the architecture?

None that require change it seems. Their blogpost says:

>We adopted the architecture outlined in the paper [The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764), but made a key modification by eliminating the Layer Normalization layers within the BitNet layers. However, we retained the original pre-attention and pre-MLP layer norms to ensure compatibility with the Llama architecture, allowing seamless integration from the outset. Interestingly, we discovered that removing these Layer Normalization layers had no adverse effect on model performance, while also ensuring compatibility with the broader ecosystem with minimal adjustments.

Well, pretending that `falcon_e` is the same as `falcon3`, it appears to work:
```
./bin/llama-cli -m test.gguf -c 8192 -s 5678 -n 128 -p "I believe the meaning of life is" -t 16

I believe the meaning of life is to create a legacy and have a positive impact on the world, and that the purpose of life is to learn from experiences and grow as a person. I believe that human existence is a journey of self-discovery and exploration, and that the ultimate goal of life is to find meaning and purpose in the experiences and challenges that we face. 

I hope that you will take my words to heart and consider the impact that I have had on your life, and that you will continue to learn and grow as a person. I believe that life is a gift, and that it is up to each of us to use our experiences and challenges to our

Perplexity seems reasonable too:

See [#555](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/555) and let me know of it works.
