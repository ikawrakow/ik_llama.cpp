## ðŸ“„ Description

### What happened?

With the experts being quite large on bigger MoE models, if we were able to split by row instead of layers, it'd allow a much more even balancing of the model across multiple cards.

Is `-split-mode row` something that we can get working? As of right now, it doesn't seem to work with DeepSeek V3/R1.

### Name and Version

Current main

### What operating system are you seeing the problem on?

Linux

### Relevant log output

```shell

```

Would be nice, I agree. 

Here 3 examples from the CUDA code where the comments/asserts say that split tensors are not supported.

Most noticeably, there is clearly no support for MoE models with split tensors. This is not code I wrote, it is inherited from upstream.

Hmm, yeah, it seems as though there's not a lot we can do in that case with splitting MoE based tensors.
