## ðŸ“„ Description

The THUDM dev [zRzRzRzRzRzRzR](https://github.com/zRzRzRzRzRzRzR) seems to be adding support for a new yet unreleased `THUDM/GLM-4-MoE-100B-A10B` model architechture to vLLM currently [here](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/20736/files#diff-c2cd72327248d1c1aa3d4b29ec9e47314d9893bfeff94e927841cd640fac84c1R351)

It is not confirmed, but this demo might be hosting the model currently: https://chat.z.ai/

Some more speculation on [r/LocalLLaMA here as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lw71av/glm4_moe_incoming/).

If it looks promising, I might try to add support for this nice sized MoE when it is ready.

Yes, I look forward to this release myself!

Just a heads up though, the name appears to be a placeholder:
