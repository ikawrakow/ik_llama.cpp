Crashes here without even trying to load and malloc the GGUF. After disabling this code block:
```ggml.c:12967
#if GGML_USE_IQK_MULMAT
    if (src1->type != vec_dot_type && dst->type == GGML_TYPE_F32) {
        const size_t row_size = ggml_row_size(vec_dot_type, ne10);
        for (int64_t i13 = 0; i13 < ne13; i13++)
            for (int64_t i12 = 0; i12 < ne12; i12++)

                            vec_dot_type, (const char *)wdata + (i12*ne11 + i13*

        return;
    }
IQK_MulMat_Not_Available2:;
#endif
```

... seems to make it work with these files, but still crashes with Fimbulvetr Q4_1. Works with stable-code-3b-q5_k_m.gguf even without any modification, though. Also everything works on Linux. This is a Win7 PC with Strawberry Perl's gcc version 8.3.0 (x86_64-posix-seh, Built by strawberryperl.com project).

Stock llama.cpp works.

Seems really weird, any hints on debugging this?

Seems to be different perhaps?.. Still, works with stock llama.cpp.

Can you post your `system_info` message when these crashes happen? It should look something like this
```
system_info: n_threads = 16 / 32 | AVX = 1 | AVX_VNNI = 0 | AVX2 = 1 | AVX512 = 1 | AVX512_VBMI = 1 | AVX512_VNNI = 1 | AVX512_BF16 = 1 | FMA = 1 | NEON = 0 | SVE = 0 | ARM_FMA = 0 | F16C = 1 | FP16_VA = 0 | WASM_SIMD = 0 | BLAS = 0 | SSE3 = 1 | SSSE3 = 1 | VSX = 0 | MATMUL_INT8 = 0 | LLAMAFILE = 1 |
```

Thanks!

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-08-31** at **10:50:07**

I was suspecting something I might have missed between `AVX2` and `AVX`, but no, you have `AVX2`.

I have no access to a Windows box, and even less to Windows 7 with GCC 8.3, so not sure how to debug.

With the second crash you posted a bt (the one during quantization), what are the values of `k`, `nb`, `i4` and `ir`?

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-08-31** at **11:56:33**

Hmm no, all of these are results of llama-cli, not quantize.

```
1397                y4[i4].d[ir+4] = GGML_FP32_TO_FP16(d * hsum_i32_8(_mm256_add
_epi32(_mm256_add_epi32(i0, i1), _mm256_add_epi32(i2, i3))));
(gdb) p k
$1 = 4096
(gdb) p nb
$2 = 128
(gdb) p i4
$3 = 0
(gdb) p ir
$4 = 0
```

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-08-31** at **12:22:17**

Then `y4` must be `null`?

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-08-31** at **14:33:20**

```
(gdb) p y4
$5 = (block_q8_1_x4 * restrict) 0x3870ca0
```

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-08-31** at **15:57:55**

So
* `y4` is not null
* We attempt to store data into bytes `12...16` of the memory block pointed to by `y4`. The memory block is 4608 bytes (the row size of `Q8_1`-quantized tensor row with 4096 elements), so we are not having an out-of-bounds access
* We get `SIGSEGV`, so we are attempting to write to memory not accessible to us
* Hence, `y4` is somehow pointing to outside of our process address space
* As this is not possible to happen in this specific function, there are two options
  - We overwrote memory somewhere else, thus corrupting the pointer passed into the crashing function. A bug like this can only be meaningfully debugged with an address sanitizer or `valgrind`. Is one of those available on this Windows box?
  - GCC miscompiled the code. You mention that the program sometimes crashes even before loading the model, so this kind of supports this possibility

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-08-31** at **19:21:42**

Ehm, looks like it's not gonna be that easy... Just tried with TDM-GCC's gcc version 10.3.0 (tdm64-1), and the results are the same.

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-08-31** at **19:29:10**

Hmm... Could it be related that I've been disabling the -muse-unaligned-vector-move assembler flag? I don't have a recent enough binutils for it, and llama.cpp's been working so far...

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-08-31** at **19:46:57**

Alas, no... Same crash with latest mingw's gcc 14.1 and binutils 2.42.

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-09-01** at **09:34:15**

If you tried 3 different compiler versions and the crash persists, then it is more likely that it is a bug in the code that somehow only shows up on Windows (any Windows or just Windows 7?).

I see [here](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerWindowsPort) that one can use the address sanitizer with `clang` for Windows.  If you can get it going that way, this might help find the problem.

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-01** at **19:57:45**

Okay "good news", I've compiled it with the same TDM-GCC on a Windows 11 box (with -mno-avx512f, because it's a much newer CPU), and it crashes there too.

It works when compiled with the default AVX512 setting.

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-09-02** at **08:54:50**

Do you find it important to disable AVX512?

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-02** at **16:31:29**

Well since the Windows 7 PC in question is only AVX2, I kinda absolutely have to, in order to maintain the comparison...

So it'd seem to me that there's some AVX2 bug going on on all Windows OSes? I'll check if I can do some address sanitizing checks, but sounds extremely painful.

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-02** at **16:38:57**

I can set up an rdesktop access if that's at all helpful.

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-09-02** at **17:31:21**

`-march=native` does not work? This enables the features your CPU supports. If you are setting this manually, you need `FMA` and `F16C` in addition to `AVX2`

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-03** at **18:21:16**

Err, I think you misunderstood. I'm using the default flags as usual. In order to test the AVX2 code on the PC which has Windows 11 (to check if it's a 7 vs 11 issue), I had to disable AVX512 on that box - naturally.

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-14** at **17:00:21**

> I can set up an rdesktop access if that's at all helpful.

Sooo... no?

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-09-15** at **06:25:32**

We can try, but I'm not very hopeful as I haven't touched a Windows computer for 10+ years. What is the Linux rdesktop client one uses these days? I'm on Ubuntu 22.04.

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-15** at **08:41:29**

Well, it's called just that, "rdesktop". It works fine. I'll set it up then. Err, can github do private messages? If not, I have Telegram.

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-09-15** at **10:01:30**

As far as I can tell the private message feature has been removed from Githib. I don't have Telegram. I made my email address public. If you fetch the latest main branch the last commit will have my email.

---

üë§ **whoreson** commented on **2024-09-15** at **11:45:28**

Cool, just sent you an e-mail (from s*.t*@gmail).

---

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2024-09-19** at **08:49:48**

So, I used the provided `rdesktop` access to try to debug - without success. Supporting exotic systems (and yes, a Windows 7 box in the year 2024 is an exotic system on my book) is not one of the goals here - you are much better served with the mainline `llama.cpp` project.
