## üìÑ Description

### Background Description

`iqk_mul_mat.cpp` compilation time has become unacceptably long. If I keep going that way soon it will rival CUDA build times.

As an experiment at some point I factored out the Flash Attention (FA) part from the matrix multiplication code. This resulted in a FA build time of ~45 seconds and GEMM/GEMV build time of ~30 seconds, so better than the ~75 seconds I observe for `iqk_mul_mat.cpp` on my Ryzen-7950X, but still far from really useful, so I did not commit.  

### Possible Refactor Approaches
