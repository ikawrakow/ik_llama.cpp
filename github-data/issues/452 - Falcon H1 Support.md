## 📄 Description

A hybrid transformers/mamba2 series with good performance: https://huggingface.co/collections/tiiuae/falcon-h1-6819f2795bc406da60fab8df

Officially supported via their fork of llama.cpp here: https://github.com/tiiuae/llama.cpp-Falcon-H1

Support for ik_llama.cpp's tighter quantization schemes would be nice :). Maybe something in this fork can shrink the Mamba2 context cache as well?

Have you though about adding a feature request to the llama.cpp-Falcon-H1 authors?

Seems their implementation needs more time in the oven anyway.
