## ðŸ“„ Description

### Prerequisites

- [X] I am running the latest code. Mention the version if possible as well.
- [X] I carefully followed the [README.md](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/README.md).
- [X] I searched using keywords relevant to my issue to make sure that I am creating a new issue that is not already open (or closed).
- [X] I reviewed the [Discussions](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions), and have a new and useful enhancement to share.

### Feature Description

Recent open source / open weight models provide long context window, and hence it would be useful to improve CPU processing speed for large prompts. 

### Motivation

See [#25](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/25) 

### Possible Implementation

See [#25](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/25)
