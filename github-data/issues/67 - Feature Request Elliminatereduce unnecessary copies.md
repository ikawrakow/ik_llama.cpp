### Feature Description

PR [#66](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/66) does it for Phi-3(.5)-mini, with a non-negligible performance gain on GPUs. Architectures that could potentially benefit from the same optimization are Falcon, DBRX, Starcoder, Bert, Bloom, MPT, Qwen, Phi-2, GPT-2, Codeshell, OpenLM, GPT-Neox, ChatGLM.

### Motivation

Improve performance

### Possible Implementation
