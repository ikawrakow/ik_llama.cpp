## üìÑ Description

HI there, thanks for your work!

I have found, from this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1joyl9t/new_gguf_quants_of_v30324/, about some new quants of ik_llamacpp

My system consits of a AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 192GB RAM, RTX 5090, RTX 4090x2 and an RTX A6000. OS is Fedora 41.

The model used is https://huggingface.co/ubergarm/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4

I'm running it with

`/llama-server -m '/DeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4-00001-of-00005.gguf' -c 8192 -ngl 27 -ts 17,20,21,45 --no-warmup -mla 2` (or -mla 1)

I did build ik_llama.cpp with

`cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON -DGGML_CUDA_F16=ON -DGGML_IQK_FA_ALL_QUANTS=1`

The issue seems to be that, when trying to generate with any prompt, the output is gibberish (just DDDDDD)

Log is this one

Maybe I'm using the flag incorrectly, or I didn't build ik_llama.cpp correctly?

When not using -mla, model seems to work normally, abeit slower than UD_Q2_K_XL (https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF/tree/main/UD-Q2_K_XL)

EDIT: To note that other models have the same issue (like the mentioned above), but those probably aren't expected to work since they aren't quanted with ik_llama.cpp

I'm not sure why your getting bad output, but you might want to look into https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/232 instead of just setting `-ngl` this is more tested and offers much higher performance.

More info about using it here: https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/258

@saood06 Thanks for the suggestion! I did see the post but not sure how to exactly use it, because it seems to use it on a single GPU for all the layers, but on my case I'm using 27 layers of 61 and multiGPU, not sure how to adapt it.

I also did try with -mla 2 and -fa but same issue.

I will try to rebuild with `cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON -DGGML_IQK_FA_ALL_QUANTS=1 -DGGML_BLAS=OFF` to see if it helps.

The goal is to use your CPU for the large pool of experts, and use the GPU for the rest. I'm not sure if the code as it is currently benefits from using more than one GPU though.

See https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/242#discussioncomment-12452986 for someone else using `-ot` and spreading those tensors across multiple GPU's (and his edit showing only one GPU was active).

Oh just saw it, seems interesting! Probably will take a while to understand it, since I read it a bit lightly and didn't understand much.

Now, still no luck with `cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS=ON -DGGML_IQK_FA_ALL_QUANTS=1 -DGGML_BLAS=OFF`, so not sure if I'm missing something else :(

Let me know if you have any more questions, my Deepseek machine doesn't have a GPU (let alone multiple) so I can't test, but I have seen others have good success with `-ot`

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2025-04-02** at **05:21:58**

This model is not ideal for your multi-GPU setup. The row-interleaved quants (`X_R4, X_R8`) are best for CPU-only inference. They do not have CUDA matrix multiplication implementation, so all matrix multiplications involving them will run on the CPU, so yes, it will be slower (and your GPU's will be acting as very expensive RAM modules for your CPU).

But apart from this it still should work, and I don't know why t doesn't. I ended up in a situation where all users coming here want to use `ik_llama.cpp` for DeepSeek-V3/R1, but I don't have the hardware to run these models, so not able to debug when issues arise.

> EDIT: To note that other models have the same issue (like the mentioned above), but those probably aren't expected to work since they aren't quanted with ik_llama.cpp

All supported models working with mainline `llama.cpp` are supposed to work also here.

It has `llama_model_loader: - type q8_0:  612 tensors`, this is ubergarm's mix where those are on the tensors that are better suited for GPU.

So if he uses -ot then he will be able to offload all those to GPU(s), leaving just the row-interleaved quants to the CPU

Yes, that's true. But that way they will be using a small fraction of the 120 GB VRAM available.

In the linked discussion the commenter was never able to get more than one GPU to be active, has that been fixed? "Main GPU usage is at 25% and other cards are at 0% when generating." and "When removing -fmoe, the GPU usage is still centralized on the main GPU, with 20-25% usage at 130-140w, while the other cards stay at 0% at ~100w."

üë§ **ikawrakow** commented on **2025-04-02** at **05:59:32**

If you have been using UD_Q2_K_XL, try running it with this fork the same way you have in mainline, but add
```
-fmoe -rtr -ub 2048
```
to your server command line. Loading the model will take longer, but then inference will be hopefully faster. The `-ub 2048` option will only have impact on prompt processing speed, so if TG is your main use case, you may leave it out. 

As @saood06 suggested, for best performance you should experiment with tensor overrides (`-ot`). Ideally, all attention and all shared experts should run on the GPUs. Then make use of the remaining VRAM to offload as many MoE tensors as will fit to the GPUs. It may be better to have all `ffn_down_exps` tensors left on the CPU, and instead have more of `ffn_up_exps` and `ffn_gate_exps` offloaded to the GPU. Example:
```
/llama-server -m '/DeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4-00001-of-00005.gguf' -c 8192 -ngl 100 -ts 17,20,21,45 \
-ot "ffn_down_exps=CPU,blk\.4[0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps=CPU,blk\.5[0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps=CPU,blk\.6[0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps=CPU"
```
will have all `ffn_down_exps` tensors and the `ffn_up/gate_exps` for layers 40-end on the CPU, everything else on the GPUs. If that does not fit, or if you have unused VRAM left, you can modify the regex to keep a different number of `ffn_up/gate_exps` tensors on the CPU.

I remember [#242](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/242), but I don't have multiple GPUs to understand why the issue occurs. Apart from this, @davidsyoung has been using it with 16 x 3090, and I do not recall him reporting that only one GPU is being used.

Yes but maybe it is different if it offloaded fully to CUDA, because ThomasBaruzier's who had the issue his comments are at a time when davidsyoung was using ik_llama.cpp. Maybe @Panchovix you can tell us if all GPU's are being used  when putting tensors on all of them with -ot.

Hey just wanted to jump in as tagged above. 

I never had an issue personally while using with all GPUs being used, but it‚Äôs going to be dependent on how tensors/attention is being balanced across GPUs. 

I didn‚Äôt have a mixed workflow of CPU/GPU offload like this, but if I was debugging I would go the route of what @ikawrakow is suggesting. 

I would also likely just to start, use a less exotic quantisation to rule that out. As you‚Äôre doing a mixed offload of GPU/CPU, I would use a standard Q4 quant. 

Then from there, I would use -ot commands like suggested above. 

Lower down the list of possibilities could be the -mla option you‚Äôre using, as it‚Äôs possible that combination of mixed offload, quant format, and those commands possibly haven‚Äôt been tested too heavily. 

It may also just simply be the model with Q2 quant.

Process of elimination!

Hi there guys, just woke up and saw all the new information, many thanks! I will try the suggestions when I come home after work (in about 11 hours).

I will try some normal quants (123B at Q4_M_K or Q6_K). If those aren't quanted with ik_llamacpp, would they work with -mla 2?
I will try these with both full GPU and CPU + GPU.

From my understanding -ot may result in better performance but not address the gibberish output when using MLA 2 right? But even then, if not using MLA it will probably help (I can take 3-4 t/s while generating, but pre processing is really slow, it takes some minutes to start to generate. Probably because slow RAM (5600Mhz) and PCI-E speeds (X16/X4/X4/X4))

I did try a little via RDP (on Windows though, as I haven't managed to get a RDP client working unattended on Linux)

With `-fmoe -rtr -ub 2048` I get CUDA OOM (with stock -c 8192 -ngl 22 -ts 17,20,21,45 --no-warmup.) Without -ub it loads but it seems to use shared RAM into the GPUs, so it never gens. With just -fmoe it seems to work normally.

With `-ot "ffn_down_exps=CPU,blk\.4[0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps=CPU,blk\.5[0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps=CPU,blk\.6[0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps=CPU"` I also get CUDA OOM (with `-c 8192 -ngl 100 -ts 17,20,21,45`)

With the mix of the 2, I also get OOM.

I will try later on Linux to see how it behaves.

Probably I really don't know how to set up the -ot values and/or what does rtr with ub do. I'm new on llamacpp as previously I mostly used other backends with only GPU support and not shared CPU+GPU, so pardon me for my ignorance.

Heya @Panchovix , glad you found my reddit post and tried the model. I updated the model card to hopefully explain better that those quants are specifically designed for 24-48GB VRAM systems.

You, however, have a more complex setup with multiple GPUs. 

I would suggest that you start small and try to get some success using just a single GPU for example. Then as you learn, move up to bigger models and offload layers as you desire learning how to use `-ot`. I have [a rough guide](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/258) with links to discussions for some of the features of this fork, this might be a good place to start digging in and learning.

> I will try some normal quants (123B at Q4_M_K or Q6_K). If those aren't quanted with ik_llamacpp, would they work with -mla 2?

As mentioned: "All supported models working with mainline llama.cpp are supposed to work also here."  So `ik_llama.cpp` can generate MLA tensors on the fly models that support MLA e.g. R1 and V3 models at least. I'm not sure what 123B model you are talking about though, if you mean Mistral-Large-Instruct, I don't think that default model architecture supports MLA.

Its possible I saw you over on level1techs forum too, feel free to reach out to me there if you want some help getting started. Cheers!

@ubergarm Thanks! But I think the model won't fit on 192GB RAM + 48GB RAM? Correct me if I'm wrong though. I will checkout the guide!

I will install Debian for a bit more stability than Fedora (though, Debian 13) and will try.

And ah I see, I was thinking of Mistral yeah, but it makes sense only Deepseek supports MLA.

I think I went some time ago on level1techs, but never went much anymore because it is too advanced for me haha.

>  192GB RAM + 48GB RAM

So the `IQ2_K_R4` is 226 GiB, of which about 17.33 GiB are layers designed for offload to GPU so that leaves ~210GiB for RAM. So technically it would work okay and probably get you 2-3 tok/sec because `mmap()` can leave some weights on disk and still run out of page cache. You could use the command I provided on the huggingface model card just for a test.

> I think I went some time ago on level1techs

Oops nope, there is a different person over there asking about using multiple GPUs like this! Thanks!

@ubergarm and @ikawrakow 
embedding needs to be iq3_k to emulate IQ2_M for way better coding performance.  ikawrakow, can you make that into the IQ2_K_M, IQ2_K_M_R4 standard?

Hey bud, which `embedding` are you talking about? If you check the model card side-bar on hf for the [DeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4](https://huggingface.co/ubergarm/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF?show_file_info=DeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4%2FDeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4-00001-of-00005.gguf) (about which I assume you are referring?), the `token_embd.weight` is `q8_0`? 

> can you make that into the IQ2_K_M, IQ2_K_M_R4 standard?

This fork allows the user to cook up whatever combinations they want with `llama-quantize --quantize-q` ... (and my recipe is shown on the hf model card too). I'm not sure where you're talking about `IQ2_K_M` or `IQ2_K_M_R4` those are not quants with which I'm familiar. You can see the [quants available listed in the `quantize` code here](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/blob/main/examples/quantize/quantize.cpp#L26).

Sorry I'm confused, if you have a specific reference to the exact quant in question I'll be back in office later this week. Cheers!

HI there! Closing as MLA was recently merged into main llamacpp, and it seems to work with CUDA as for now, with newer quants (https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF-UD)

Many thanks for all the info!

EDIT: Re-opening as no luck for now either on main llamacpp

@Panchovix 

I see you over on https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF-UD/discussions/2#680d23a4806b446ebce4d723

Did you ever try running this fork with my one of [my quants](https://huggingface.co/ubergarm/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF) using the provided commands on the model card?

Just to start out don't use all your GPUs at once, just use one of them and use `-ot exps=CPU` to see if you get it working.

Once you have something working, then you can figure out how to to optimize for all your GPUs. 

I have not tried that new "Unsloth Dynamic v2.0" quant with MLA, and am not sure how they even generated the [imatrix given bartowski was having issues with that](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/12801#issuecomment-2824767949) which commented on further down.

Hi there @ubergarm, I did try IQ2_K_R4, but with multiple GPUs. The issue is that with just one GPU, I tried but the model didn't fit with RAM + VRAM (In theory it should but it gave me OOM anywayas).

As mentioned there, on llamacpp the error seems a bit different, outputing gibberish at a bit larger contexts but starts fine, while with R4 I get just "DDDDD" on any ctx.

üë§ **ubergarm** commented on **2025-04-27** at **01:38:32**

@Panchovix 

Right I think you were trying to run `_R4` quants on a GPU (because you were trying to use `-ngl` without `-ot`) when they are designed only for CPU inference psure.

Give this a try:
```
# Install build dependencies and cuda toolkit as needed
git clone https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp
cd ik_llama.cpp

# Configure CUDA+CPU Backend
cmake -B ./build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_BLAS=OFF
# Build
cmake --build ./build --config Release -j $(nproc)

# Confirm
./build/bin/llama-server --version
version: 3640 (xxxxxxxx)
built with cc (GCC) 14.2.1 20250128 for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu

# API Server using single GPU running out of mmap() only needs >~64GB RAM
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0" \
./build/bin/llama-server \
    --model ubergarm/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF/DeepSeek-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4.gguf \
    --alias ubergarm/DeepSeek-R1-V3-0324-IQ2_K_R4 \
    --ctx-size 16384 \
    -ctk f16 \
    -mla 2 -fa \
    -amb 512 \
    -fmoe \
    --temp 0.3 \
    --min-p 0.05 \
    --n-gpu-layers 63 \
    --override-tensor exps=CPU \
    --parallel 1 \
    --threads 16 \
    --host 127.0.0.1 \
    --port 8080
```

You can also try the various unsloth/bartowski/mradermacher quants (though I've not tested unsloth's new MLA quant on mainline `llama.cpp` nor this `ik_llama.cpp` fork... You just can't use `-rtr` with those as that would disable `mmap` and likely OOM you.

Let me know what errors you get if any trying it this way. If you are still OOMing what is the output of `sudo dmesg -T | grep -i oom` or similar... Thanks!

Sorry for the delay, haven't tested yet as I was trying with normal llamacpp to see how it behaves.

I have a question, though, as -ot seems to be pretty poluar now. Sorry if it's a too novice question.

How can I know the layers, the experts, the size of the experts and such to try to use -ot? For example, Since DeepSeek V3 0324 is 685B, I "assume" active params are 38B. Then, it is each expert 38B as well? Then, for example, IQ2_K_XL/IQ2_K_R4, the size of each of those is about is 2.71 bpw. So, each expert would be 2.71bpw size of each expert?

üë§ **Panchovix** commented on **2025-04-29** at **04:34:52**

Just an small update, found https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF-UD/discussions/2#680fad80e3c723c4b1f20c63, then I tested https://huggingface.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-V3-0324-GGUF-UD/discussions/2#681047075bb07c42d7e44256

The suspicious that -ot would work, it does.

If you load the active parameters all on GPU and then offload the experts to CPU and some CUDA devices, it works fine.

The moment you load the active parameters with mixed CPU + CUDA, it outputs gibberish.

Same seems to happen here with IQ2_K_R4.

So it is maybe resolved? But the issue seems to come when MLA is mixed with active parameters + mixed CPU/GPU.

> How can I know the layers, the experts, the size of the experts and such to try to use -ot?

The easiest way is to look at the hugging face model card sidebar e.g. for [bartowski/THUDM_GLM-4-32B-0414-GGUF/THUDM_GLM-4-32B-0414-Q4_K_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/THUDM_GLM-4-32B-0414-GGUF?show_file_info=THUDM_GLM-4-32B-0414-Q4_K_M.gguf)

This does not show everything for ik_llama.cpp exclusive quants e.g. `iq4_k` as hugging face doesn't fully support those. 

The longer answer is that this is the output you get from `./gguf-py/scripts/gguf_dump.py`

Don't run any `_R4` quants on GPU. Those are repacked for CPU use.

You have a unique rig, 4x GPUs and 4x DIMMs in what I understand to be a gamer class AM5 MoBo. You can get good performance out of that, but it will require more complex consideration.

Keeps us posted on your progress and benchmarks as you progress in your journey!

Thanks! Yeah, I have 2 motherboards, a X670E Aorus Master and a X670 MSI Carbon, but using the latter now as it lets me use 4x48GB at 6000Mhz.

At some point I want to change to a threadripper/epyc processor.
