## üìÑ Description

Trying to load Deepseek 32B (specifically an IQ4_KS_RQ quantization I just made) with the -mla 2 (or -mla any value) flag gives me a segfault.

`./build/bin/llama-server --model /Models/GGUF/Deepseek-32B-IQ4_KS_R4.gguf --ctx-size 2048 -mla 2 -fa --n-gpu-layers 65 --parallel 1 --threads 1 --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080`


```
...
llama_kv_cache_init: layer 63: n_embd_head_qk_rope = 128, kv_lora_rank = 0
llama_kv_cache_init:      CUDA0 KV buffer size =    32.00 MiB
llama_new_context_with_model: KV self size  =   32.00 MiB, c^KV (f16):   32.00 MiB, kv^T: not used
llama_new_context_with_model:  CUDA_Host  output buffer size =     1.16 MiB
fish: Job 1, './build/bin/llama-server --mode‚Ä¶' terminated by signal SIGSEGV (Address boundary error)

```
Is that only supported by full Deepseek MoE, not the Qwen distills?

As far as I know, the distilled models use a standard attention mechanism (same as the underlying model used to prepare the distillation, i.e., Qwen, LLaMA-3, etc.). At least [this one](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-GGUF) does.

I guess, I should add checks to only allow MLA when we have a model using MLA.

Interesting, thanks. I'm playing catch up here, and did find the MLA paper.


What major models *do* support MLA? Just the MoE deepseek releases? Adapted finetunes hiding on huggingface?

As far as I know, DeepSeek-V2/V3/R1/Lite are the models that use MLA.

Thanks! And I appreciate you posting this repo.
