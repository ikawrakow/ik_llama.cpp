## ðŸ“„ Description

### Prerequisites

- [x] I am running the latest code. Mention the version if possible as well.
- [x] I carefully followed the [README.md](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/README.md).
- [x] I searched using keywords relevant to my issue to make sure that I am creating a new issue that is not already open (or closed).
- [x] I reviewed the [Discussions](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions), and have a new and useful enhancement to share.

### Feature Description

With the original llama.cpp they added a flag to enable cors:

https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/5781/commits/1e6a2f12c6453d7b5158b37c8a789fd3934af044

However I don't see that added to ik_llama(great work by the way, love this project!)

Is there any plans to enable CORS in the future?

### Motivation

I use an application endpoint that requires CORS to interract, It works with llama-cp with the --public-domain flag.

### Possible Implementation

_No response_

You could use any reverse proxy to add this yourself e.g. nginx, caddy server, etc.

Also someone created a wrapper/reverse-proxy like thing to support tool calling and other openai style endpoint stuff it seems: https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/403#discussioncomment-13098276
