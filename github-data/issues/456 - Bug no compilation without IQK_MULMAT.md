## 📄 Description

### What happened?

IK_LLama won't compile without IQK_Mulmat's compilation activated.

### Name and Version

Last version, PR446 merged

### What operating system are you seeing the problem on?

Win11, MSVS

### Relevant log output

```shell
The cause is probably in ggml.c

Line 15044/45 :

"#if GGML_USE_IQK_MULMAT
static void ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat_id_up_gate("

So, the OP "GGML_OP_MOE_FUSED_UP_GATE" involving
ggml_"compute_forward_mul_mat_id_up_gate",
OP which is not under the condition "#if GGML_USE_IQK_MULMAT",
will not be compiled because "static void ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat_id_up_gate" is not available.
```

It no longer works without `GGML_USE_IQK_MULMAT`, so I'll just remove that option.
