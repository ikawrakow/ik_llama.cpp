## üìå [Issue #383](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/383) - Bug: Loading DeepSeek R1T Chimera causes "llama_model_load: error loading model: check_tensor_dims: tensor 'blk.0.attn_q_b.weight' has wrong shape; expected  1536, 73728, got  1536, 24576,     1,     1"

## üìÑ Description

### What happened?

I tried loading https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-Q4_K_M and get this error (the same model loads fine with llama.cpp):

```
llama_model_load: error loading model: check_tensor_dims: tensor 'blk.0.attn_q_b.weight' has wrong shape; expected  1536, 73728, got  1536, 24576,     1,     1
```

Original model: https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera

It is a merge of DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 (0324). It is quite well made too, bringing together good qualities of both models, not sure though why it fails in ik_llama.cpp. At first I tried to run repacked model with llama-quantize, but then I also tried to run the original quant, I also tried with or without -rtr and CPU-only without any cache quantization and without flash attention (just specifying ctx-size and model to load), with the same outcome unfortunately.

### Name and Version

The reason you are seeing an error is the MLA implementation here and in mainline is no longer compatible, and the model linked is using the incompatible MLA implementation. We support creating the MLA tensors on the fly for models that existed before the MLA implementation or models that are converted using convert_hf_to_gguf.py from this repo, where it will add the MLA tensors used here.

If you want to use the model you can by directly converting from https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera (although using this https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-bf16/tree/main may be easier (at the cost of more download [file is double the size but using xet you might be able to transfer a similar amount of data]) as otherwise you will have to first convert to bf16.

Oh, I see. Is there a way to somehow salvage https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-Q4_K_M quant, either remove or convert incompatible MLA tensors? Maybe there is a way to upconvert it to bf16 and then from there to the quant I need, or that wouldn't work? Unfortunately no other quants on huggingface exist.

https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera seems to have 163 files, mostly 4.3 GB in size, so about 700GB or half a month of downloading non-stop in my case, or maybe two months if I get speed limited for the rest of the month (since I already made multiple downloads this month and have 1TB traffic limit per month before speed is limited).

If nothing can be done and it is not a bug, I understand, but I suggest considering adding a clear error message, so it would be easier for users to understand that they are trying to run incompatible quant.

You probably could make a script that does that (I have been meaning to make one that merges my V3 and R1 GGUF in the same way chimera does to avoid downloading it since as you know these models are large).

>Maybe there is a way to upconvert it to bf16 and then from there to the quant I need, or that wouldn't work?

Converting to bf16 is needed before making a GGUF, what you are suggesting has been done (how the leaked quantized Miqu GGUF was turned back into a safetensor), but is not relevant to you.

>Unfortunately no other quants on huggingface exist.

I know I looked as well.

> If nothing can be done and it is not a bug, I understand, but I suggest considering adding a clear error message, so it would be easier for users to understand that they are trying to run incompatible quant.

We may end up doing that, I know for now the README for this repo mentions it saying:

>The new GGUFs for DeepSeek-V3/R1/Lite do not work in this repository. This is due to the backwards incompatibe change in mainline llama.cpp that https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/12801 2.5 months after MLA was available here, and worked with the original DeepSeek GGUFs. Please use the original GGUF or, if you don't have one, convert the HF safetnosrs using the Python conversion scrip in this repository.

I downloaded the same not compatible quant few days ago, but seeing this bug report inspired me to create a request for the quant creator to consider create one that is compatible with ik_llama.cpp https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF/discussions/1 (I figured if it is not just me who needs it, maybe they will consider it). I am yet to download full version of it to make my own quant (I will not be able to upload it though, since I have less than 1 Mbps for upload but around 10-40 Mbps for download).

I ran some tests using llama.cpp and noticed that llama.cpp has a bug that makes it produce gibberish unless CUDA is disabled - https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/13327 (my guess though it may not apply to ik_llama.cpp since probably caused by their MLA implementation). I thought I mention this just in case someone testing with llama.cpp and ik_llama.cpp.

Given how much ik_llama.cpp implementation is more mature and faster (by more than two times), it is surprising to me that people create so many quants specific to llama.cpp, but there are very few ones specific to ik_llama.cpp. But in the meantime, it looks like downloading full version and creating own GGUF quant is the only choice.

I still think a a script somewhat inspired by https://huggingface.co/stduhpf/google-gemma-3-27b-it-qat-q4_0-gguf-small/blob/main/swap_embeds.py could remove the incorrect tensors (and maybe even insert the correct ones if you happen to have a model with the correct ones since for on my machine the on the fly MLA tensors come with a small performance penalty).

I haven't downloaded the Chimera model because I have both V3 and R1, and don't want to waste bandwidth when I could just make a script that combines them, but I haven't been curious enough about the model to do it yet.

>I am yet to download full version of it to make my own quant (I will not be able to upload it though, since I have less than 1 Mbps for upload but around 10-40 Mbps for download).

I also have an asymmetric download/upload rate which is why I also can't really upload something Deepseek sized.

It is because less people know about and thus use ik_llama.cpp. It also doesn't help that model support here generally comes later (Deepseek's MLA implementation being an exception), and llama.cpp sometimes even gets 0-day support for models.

This is why I added the IMPORTANT note on the ik_llama.cpp main page, hoping to prevent at least some users wasting their time and traffic limits downloading a giant incompatible model.

I personally find the approach taken in mainline llama.cpp plain irresponsible. There was no reason to introduce the incompatibility. The tensors necessary for MLA can be created on-the-fly as done here.

Minor note, there are some typos in that note: "scrip" and "safetnosrs".

Edit: Thanks for fixing it.

I tested it further, and I think a script will not help in this case. Even though https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-Q4_K_M is similar in size to old Q4_K_M quant of R1 by Unsloth (when they did not have UD XL version of it), the quality is much lower. It failed many tests, most of my tests are specific to my real world use cases, but some are generic public tests or common questions, for example easiest one to check and that reveals quantization degradation in reasoning models very well, is the [maze test](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j4lqe6/test_if_your_api_provider_is_quantizing_your/) - Chimera at OpenRouter passes it, and so does Q4_K_M quant of R1 from Unsloth, but https://huggingface.co/bullerwins/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-Q4_K_M consistently fails it.

The point is, even if it was possible to somehow recover this Q4 quant to make it work with ik_llama.cpp, its quality is very bad, so it still would be necessary to recreate it from scratch. I guess I just keep downloading the full version via my 4G connection and hope the provider will not limit my speed.

So far, I only created my own repacked quants for ik_llama.cpp, but not from scratch (last time I checked, on the fly conversion was disabling mmap, so I had to repack R1 and V3 quants to use them without performance loss). I know I will need to convert to bf16 first, but I am not yet sure how to create proper quant that would be comparable to UD-Q4_K_XL from Unsloth in quality. I plan to go through some articles Unsloth posted, maybe they shared how they did it.

It may take many days before I have the full Chimera, but if I will figure out a set of commands to convert to a good ik_llama.cpp quant, I will share here (if this discussion is closed by then, then I will just edit my existing message to add the info to avoid reopening it).

This is because the `llama.cpp` experts who decided that breaking backwards compatibility is OK did not consider (or perhaps did not understand?) the implications this breaking change has on quantized models. I'll not explain so that this time they can really independently discover what it is.

I would recommend actually looking into the quant types that are exclusive to this repo see https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/8 and there is also good discussion in this issue (after the realization that token_embd.weight should not use _r4 quants) about good mixes: https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/296

I too want to try this model with it's selective thinking. I rather download it than R1 or V3 alone.

There is also this pruned version: https://huggingface.co/DevQuasar/huihui-ai.DeepSeek-V3-0324-Pruned-Coder-411B-GGUF/tree/main

Deepseek v2.5 should be safe, right? https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-V2.5-1210-GGUF/tree/main and is a similar arch to V3 to benefit from speedups?

@saood06 
> You probably could make a script that does that (I have been meaning to make one that merges my V3 and R1 GGUF in the same way chimera does to avoid downloading it since as you know these models are large).

Not 100% sure if it's correct but I made a script that attempts to do that - [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/city96/a05cb7ec6664a5085efb007497f2049b).

It's based on the discussion on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera/discussions/1) which had a reverse-engineered merge recipe for that model. At least for me, it produced a usable checkpoint with my original non-mla gguf files.

Thank you for this. I saw the beginning of that discussion but I hadn't checked back in to see your reply. At first I thought to use your script on the BF16 versions of the models I have, but I realized I don't see an imatrix of chimera that I would then be able to use, so I might just merge some already quantized (with imatrix) versions I have lying around.

I finally finished downloading unquantized Chimera, but cannot figure out how to convert it to BF16 in order to generate my own quants for ik_llama.cpp. I would greatly appreciate if anybody have any idea how to do it?

So far, I tried using DeepSeek fp8 to BF16 conversion script `fp8_cast_bf16.py`, but it fails with error `type fp8e4nv not supported in this architecture. The supported fp8 dtypes are ('fp8e4b15', 'fp8e5')`, here is the full log:

The solution I've given others and have used myself is to use [this](https://huggingface.co/daydream-org/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-11446/discussions/1#67a327570051a98a96ded9e6) method 

I mentioned this before but I'll repeat since I think it still holds true, I've thought about porting that here but the triton dependence adds more complication than I think it is worth for most people, when more fp8 native models are released, I think something along the lines of https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/10055 is the best path forward.

üë§ **Lissanro** commented on **2025-05-09** at **05:58:13**

It seems the tutorial is outdated. Just creating venv on the next step produces errors about not being able to satisfy dependencies, do you know by any chance what Python version was recommended at the time the tutorial was written? On Ubuntu 25.04, Python 3.13 is the default, but it did not work, failing to satisfy some dependencies. So I tried from scratch with older version of Python:

```
conda create -yn venv python=3.12
conda activate venv
```

Instead of these commands:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

But then I am stuck at building triton-cpu:

```

The last line does not change after some hours and there is no CPU load. If I try to add -vvv, it gets stuck here:

```

None of directories it mentions in /tmp exist, so I assume it processed them and removed. Warning seems to be harmless in Python 3.12, so I think it is not an issue either. It seems you were right about triton dependency adding complications... I tried to clean everything up, and start over, with the same outcome, or maybe I am doing something wrong, but I tried to follow tutorial steps precisely, except the necessary change to use older Python version.

I am still trying to find some way to convert, but to no avail yet. I tried looking into your second link, but it seems the patch wasn't updated in a while and no longer applies to llama.cpp, I tried few different old commits but could not find one yet where it applies successfully. Maybe I need to try even older llama.cpp commits, but not sure, if I go too far into the past, would it even support DeepSeek V3 architecture to convert to BF16? I also could not find any example command how to convert using https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/10055 - maybe it is something obvious I missed, perhaps because I never created GGUF before.

I will keep trying to find a solution and if I find one, I will share here. If someone has any ideas or an advice, I would appreciate it greatly.

I do not, but I know the system where I used triton for this is 3.13.

I am not happy to be proven right. I ran into some complications myself (but was able to get past them), but up till now I've never had someone I recommended this solution not work for them (which is why I kept recommending it even if I don't think it is the ideal solution). I am really sorry if I wasted your time with something that didn't work for you.

Taking a look at my install `pip list` has:

`triton                        3.2.0+git4ce833eb [local path]`

(more specifically this commit hash 4ce833ebbce7b91564d7cc1f30573eb1129629f9)

Looking at the path it was installed and doing a git diff (since I remember having to change things in order to get it to compile, sorry I normally have full logs but the ones for this session is one of the ones I do not have)

If you feel like trying one more time with triton (and no guarantees that it will work), you can try building the commit I was on (with my changes) on 3.13 and see if that works for you?

Issue should be fixed now on https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/commit/43a154d8b8b0e9217114577442cecb224a488d45

Can confirm you can load deepseek MLA quants with that commit.

EDIT: Can confirm Chimera works fine as well.

üë§ **Lissanro** commented on **2025-05-11** at **07:05:01**

@saood06 Thank you, I was able to create BF16 quant after all. I switched to the system version of Python 3.13 without venv, I have applied the patch you shared and also had to bump up torch version in requirements/requirements-convert_hf_to_gguf.txt to torch~=2.5.0, otherwise it refused to proceed on my system. Without venv, I also was able to build triton-cpu. I am not sure exactly what helped out of these steps, so some of them may be unneccary. I finally was able to create BF16 command using this command:

    python3 llama.cpp/convert_hf_to_gguf.py --outtype bf16 --split-max-size 50G /mnt/neuro/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-163840seq

...where llama.cpp is the special version from [the tutorial](https://huggingface.co/daydream-org/DeepSeek-R1-GGUF-11446/discussions/1#67a327570051a98a96ded9e6) you have shared earlier.

Then, using ik_llama.cpp, I created my first GGUF quant, using Q8_0 format:

```
~/pkgs/ik_llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-quantize \
/mnt/neuro/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-256x21B-163840seq-BF16-00001-of-00030.gguf \
/mnt/neuro/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-256x21B-Q8_0-163840seq.gguf \
Q8_0
```

This is usable quant, but it is slow (I get about 2 tokens/s instead of 8 tokens/s like with Q4_K_M or UD-Q4_K_XL). However, I had to consider different solution, given I already know that Q4_K_M breaks the Chimera model (since Q4_K_M from huggingface fails the [maze test](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j4lqe6/test_if_your_api_provider_is_quantizing_your/), while Q8_0 and Q6_K Chimera quant succeed, and R1 Q4 quants from Unsloth also succeed).

It turned out that creation of Dynamic Quants [is not documented yet and active work in progress](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kjshnd/comment/mrpacfb/), so I decided to go with creating IQ and imatrix based quants in the hope they work better than normal Q4_K_M from the huggingface.

This is the command I used to create imatrix.dat:

```
numactl --cpunodebind=0 --interleave=all~/pkgs/ik_llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-imatrix \
--model /mnt/neuro/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-256x21B-Q8_0-163840seq.gguf \
--ctx-size 102400 --n-gpu-layers 62 --tensor-split 15,25,30,30 -mla 1 -fa -ctk q8_0 -amb 1024 -b 4096 -ub 4096 \
-ot "blk\.3\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA0, blk\.3\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA0, blk\.3\.ffn_down_exps=CUDA0" \
-ot "blk\.4\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA1, blk\.4\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA1, blk\.4\.ffn_down_exps=CUDA1" \
-ot "blk\.5\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA2, blk\.5\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA2, blk\.5\.ffn_down_exps=CUDA2" \
-ot "blk\.6\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA3, blk\.6\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA3, blk\.6\.ffn_down_exps=CUDA3" \
-ot "ffn_down_exps=CPU, ffn_up_exps=CPU, gate_exps=CPU" \
--threads 64 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
-f ~/pkgs/imatrix/all.txt \
--ctx-size 512
```

UPDATE: I removed `-fmoe` and `-mla 3` options from the command above - it turns out, using them greatly reduced imatrix quality and this is what caused by original imatrix to be much smaller than expected - instead, it is better to use `-mla 1` without `-fmoe`.

Context length optional, but it was mentioned [here](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13199#issuecomment-2849293461) that Unsloth may be setting it to something higher than default 512, "possibly using 6144 - 12288" (later testing demonstrated that making imatrix with non-default context length does not help with long context performance, so if unsure better stick with the default 512 length).

More information about dynamic quant creation is here in comments:
https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kjshnd/is_it_possible_to_generate_my_own_dynamic_quant/
But I decided to create a normal quant with imatrix for now (UPDATE: later I tested some custom receipts, but results were worse than default settings, and Unsloth quants, even though are good, also did not prove to be better than the default, or difference was too small to measure in my limited testing).

The all.txt file is a merge of these (I had to convert parquet to txt first):
https://huggingface.co/datasets/eaddario/imatrix-calibration/resolve/main/calibration_all_large.parquet
https://gist.github.com/bartowski1182/eb213dccb3571f863da82e99418f81e8/raw/2c64bb691316d32915b188e495754ef34931ae71/calibration_datav3.txt
https://gist.github.com/bartowski1182/f003237f2e8612278a6d01622af1cb6f/raw/6cf9d7538b3a234952d927459d0ce42cb3d3ea6e/qwen_calibration_with_chat.txt
(also, some personal data, but probably will have little compared to the three datasets above).

I probably could have just used calibration_datav3.txt and nothing else, but calibration_all_large contained many languages that are not well represented in calibration_datav3.txt or qwen_calibration_with_chat.txt, and I happen to need support for multiple languages since I often do translation work.

By the way, I remember a post where someone tested creating imatrix.dat file from BF16, Q8, Q6 and some lower quants, and then creating imatrix quant from BF16 with it, and the conclusion was the result was practically identical, especially if higher quants are used to create the imatrix. I did not save the link to it at the time (it was long before now), but I thought I mention it. This means if you are short on memory, you can use Q6 or even non-imatrix Q4 if you must, but using Q8 is recommended if possible to build the imatrix.dat.

Now, we can create the final quant:

```
~/pkgs/ik_llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-quantize \
--imatrix imatrix.dat \
/mnt/neuro/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-256x21B-163840seq-BF16-00001-of-00030.gguf \
/mnt/neuro/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-256x21B-IQ4_K-163840seq.gguf \
IQ4_K
```

Note: repacking with R4 seems to be no longer needed, and may even reduce performance.

Due to my upload speed being around 1Mbps on average, I will not be able to share any of my quants, but I hope documenting the process will help others who may want to create their own quant. Even once this issue is closed, I still will be able to link here in case I want to share my steps elsewhere, since there was a lot of useful discussion and valuable information shared in this thread.

Performance is good, still getting 8 tokens/s just like with Unsloth's UD-Q4_K_XL quant for R1. 

By the way, I also confirm that loading the existing quant from huggingface works now - so it seems the original issue that was reported is fixed. It is amazing that we can now use new MLA-enabled quants created by llama.cpp, but creating own quant may help to achieve better quality and performance, especially for models with very limited selection of quants like in this case. However, figuring out how to do it was really big challenge, and I wouldn't be able to do it without help. Big thanks to @saood06 and @ikawrakow!

It is understandable, I am in the same position as are many others. I would be very grateful if you could upload the imatrix file generated (it is only 1 GB).

>>I also plan to try other methods besides IQ4_K_R4, like IQ4_NL_R4 - to see if I will get better performance on my rig with CPU+GPU inference.

`_R4` tensors should only be on the CPU. You should use non` _R4` tensors for the GPU's. Also on Ampere or newer GPU's this is relevant : https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/386.

I just tested and solved indeed, thank you so much!

I understand from the discussion that the pre-made quant from HG is not perfect, but it is all I got and I can't download the full model or even another quant this month due to bandwidth limits, so I am very grateful for being able to use the one I already have! Thanks again for fixing this.

@saood06 I have updated my previous comment based on your feedback: added imatrix link (it turned out to be 130MB) and also fixed commands to properly generate and repack quant using R4 only where needed as you have suggested (the repack pattern for CPU may need to be adjusted for a specific configuration, unless it happen to match with mine). Hope the experience I shared will be useful to those who decide to generate their own quant.

I'm not sure why it is smaller. All the imatrix files I've seen for that architecture are 987 MB. I have no idea why yours is smaller, but I really do appreciate you sharing it.

>Hope the experience I shared will be useful to those who decide to generate their own quant.

@Lissanro great job jumping through all the hoops and finding the breadcrumbs spread around github, reddit, etc!

> My imatrix: https://dragon.studio/2025/05/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-imatrix-8192seq.dat

Just curious, given the date on this is ~3 days ago, I'm guessing it wasn't created with this https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/411 ? Not sure how much it will effect you if you're using mostly >~4bpw quants.

If you're looking for speed, a recent PR improved CUDA performance on `iq4_ks`. I'm toying with maybe making a new quant something like this, just playing around for now though given I don't have enough VRAM to really make use of https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/374 with DeepSeek...

@ubergarm 
Thank you for sharing the recipe, I will give it a try, every bit of speed up will make a difference for me. I may have to wait until I get new 8TB SSD, I should get it within 1-2 days (since I ran out of space on my SSDs, and trying to load models from 16TB HDD takes hours instead of minutes like on SSD, making hard to experiment).

As of [#411](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/411), it says "This PR fixes imatrix calculation for llama.cpp-style MLA GGUFs", but I generated my imatrix from a normal GGUF derived from BF16 (using ik_llama.cpp's tools), which in turn was derived from the original fp8 model. So most likely it will not have effect on my imatrix, but please correct me if I am wrong and if it worth regenarating.

@saood06 Not sure then why my imatrix is smaller, but I created it using ik_llama.cpp's llama-imatrix, maybe the larger versions were created by some other tool, or used some special settings?

I tried creating another imatrix with default 512 context length, and then compare perplexity of quants generated from it, and this is the result (in R4 quants, only tensors that I run on CPU were repacked as R4):

```
IQ4_K_R4 from imatrix generated using n_ctx=512:
Final estimate: PPL = 3.2911 +/- 0.01817 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=512)
Final estimate: PPL = 3.0219 +/- 0.01568 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=8192)
```

```
IQ4_K_R4 from imatrix generated using n_ctx=8192
Final estimate: PPL = 3.2911 +/- 0.01816 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=512)
Final estimate: PPL = 3.0230 +/- 0.01569 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=8192)
```

```
Q6_K reference quant:
Final estimate: PPL = 3.2611 +/- 0.01791 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=512)
Final estimate: PPL = 3.0039 +/- 0.01554 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=8192)
```

The conclusion it seems that generating imatrix with longer context either does not make a difference or makes quality very slightly worse (but within margin of error, so hard to tell). So generating imatrix with the default n_ctx=512 should be sufficient (it was suggested by someone in the discussions I linked in my earlier post that Unsloth may have been using context length within 6144 - 12288 range to generate imatrix, so I wanted to see if it actually makes a difference, but apparently not).

For reference, this is the command I used to test perplexity:

```
numactl --cpunodebind=0 --interleave=all ~/pkgs/ik_llama.cpp/build/bin/llama-perplexity \
--model /path/to/model.gguf --n-gpu-layers 62 --tensor-split 25,23,26,26 \
-mla 3 -fa -ctk q8_0 -amb 1024 -fmoe \
-ot "blk\.3\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA0, blk\.3\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA0" \
-ot "blk\.4\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA1, blk\.4\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA1" \
-ot "blk\.5\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA2, blk\.5\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA2" \

--threads 64 -f /home/lissanro/pkgs/ik_llama.cpp/wikitext-2-raw/wiki.test.ra \
--ctx-size 512
```

In case someone else decides to test their quants, the command needs to be adjusted for a specific configuration, for non-repacked quants -rtr option may be needed, and ctx-size is 512 by default but can be changed if needed. And to get wiki.test.ra, I had to run the following command:

`~/pkgs/ik_llama.cpp/scripts/get-wikitext-2.sh`

I've only ever used HDDs for these quants, and yes it is quite the pain.

I think your understanding is correct. It may be worth regenerating if there turns out to be an issue leading to your smaller than expected `imatrix.dat` size but that would be a separate issue.

>Not sure then why my imatrix is smaller

I'm sorry, I'm not sure either.

I just converted [tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera](https://huggingface.co/tngtech/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera) fp8 to bf16 GGUF with evshiron's llama.cpp fork and triton-cpu. I can't run the full bf16 easily with enough RAM in a single NUMA node so just made a full q8_0 version without imatrix first. Then using the q8_0 as my baseline I kept it simple and old school with

```bash
numactl -N 0 -m 0 \
./build/bin/llama-imatrix \
    --verbosity 1 \
    -m /media/b/data2/models/ubergarm/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-Q8_0.gguf \
    -f calibration_data_v5_rc.txt \
    -o DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera.imatrix \
    --ctx-size 512 \
    --numa numactl \
    --threads 40
```
Resulting imatrix size is 942MiB and when using it to quantize it prints out: `720 importance matrix entries ... on 213 chunks`.

Hey appreciate the additional data points with your practical empirical approach. If you follow along there is already [much interesting old discussions still available](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/5263) which suggests the same.  Apparently [unsloth is using longer context length at least for some GGUF imatrix files now](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-GGUF/discussions/8#6821262ba2ff408c1deccba6) but to be honest I don't follow their logic nor yet see any clear evidence. (I'm not saying its wrong, it might be so, but I don't know.)

With luck I'll have some updated perplexity values using the latest method for generating imatrix and update you. Thanks for sharing your research!

For me it shows "load_imatrix: loaded 543 importance matrix entries from DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-imatrix.dat computed on 3660 chunks" (probably because I am using large input file) and resulting size is 130 MB. I wonder what makes mine smaller, maybe because I am creating it from Q6_K instead of Q8_0? However, my imatrix file seems to work as expected as far as I can tell.

> Possible quant recipe

I have tested the recipe for the IQ4_KS quant and based on perplexity it seems to be quite good, the size is slightly smaller, perplexity remained almost exactly the same as for IQ4_K and performance remained similar (slightly more than 8 tokens/s for both IQ4_K and IQ4_KS quants, with only necessary for CPU tensors converted to R4, on EPYC 7763 + 1 TB 3200MHz RAM + 4x3090 GPUs):

```
IQ4_KS_R4 (339G)
Final estimate: PPL = 3.2876 +/- 0.01807
Final estimate: PPL = 3.0262 +/- 0.01568
```

```
IQ4_K_R4 (356G):
Final estimate: PPL = 3.2911 +/- 0.01817 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=512)
Final estimate: PPL = 3.0219 +/- 0.01568 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=8192)
```

```
Q6_K reference quant (515G):
Final estimate: PPL = 3.2611 +/- 0.01791 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=512)
Final estimate: PPL = 3.0039 +/- 0.01554 (perplexity tested with n_ctx=8192)
```

UPDATE: Further testing revealed Q4_KS quant quality dropped significantly in reasoning tasks, most noticeable in the [maze test](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j4lqe6/test_if_your_api_provider_is_quantizing_your/):

IQ4_K_R4: 10 / 10 (100% success rate)
IQ4_KS_R4: 1 / 10 (10% success rate)

Since performance and size are similar, normal imatrix IQ4_K_R4 quant seem to be the best option.

@Lissanro 

> However, my imatrix file seems to work as expected as far as I can tell.

Yeah it seems like just having almost any imatrix is generally better than not.

I just got my first numbers on this [DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-IQ4_KS](https://huggingface.co/ubergarm/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera-GGUF#deepseek-r1t-chimera-iq4_ks)*:

```
IQ4_KS - 338.456 GiB - 4.326 BPW
Final estimate: PPL = 3.4082 +/- 0.01892
```

*EDIT*: the q8_0 came back with `Final estimate: PPL = 3.3793 +/- 0.01873` so this KS seems really good from a PPL only perspective, want to try that maze test too though if it ever finishes upload!

*it is super slow to upload, not sure it will ever finish lol... The new imatrix is at least there computed with the latest fixes from PR411

My PPL is higher than yours, could be using iq6_k for all attention, but you have the longer imatrix corpus as well. Too many variables to know for sure but at least another data point.

> Further testing revealed Q4_KS quant quality dropped significantly in reasoning tasks, most noticeable in the [maze test](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1j4lqe6/test_if_your_api_provider_is_quantizing_your/):

Huh fascinating, I wonder what is going on there. Both the K and KS have similar perplexities. I haven't looked into the maze test but will maybe try it out on some smaller models locally soon just to see. Is it failing in terms of getting the output directions correct with you as a human looking at the result? Or is it some syntactical errors with it messing up the `<|up|>` formatting resulting in a "failed" run as computed by some python script? I assume sampling may effect the output somewhat. But if it works reliably it could be a useful test, thanks for sharing!

*EDIT2*:

I went back and looked at that maze test and was wondering why the formatting looked like token strings e.g. `<|0-0|><|up_down_left_wall|><|blank|>` type stuff, and looking at the [alphamaze paper referenced](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.14669v3) they are training their model to use specific token representations of the maze.

Given most models are not trained on those specific tokens I have some questions like:
1. Wouldn't one just use some other maze representation rather than these "token like" strings?
2. Is there a better more generalized representation that would improve a model not trained specifically on alphamaze tokens' performance?
3. Is there really a sudden "break point" in quantization quality where there is a repeatable meaningful difference e.g. `iq4_k` can solve the maze with 95% chance but slightly smaller `iq4_ks` can only solve it say 15% chance, and if so, does this generalize to indicate similar sudden gap in performance in other tasks or not?

I guess I'm not sure it applies to use this tokenized style maze test on models not trained to recognize those tokens? This is from the paper:

> (SFT) approach on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B architecture. This model was trained to directly predict the complete sequence of movement tokens representing the solution path through a given maze

This specific alpha maze test seems to be used on SFTd models to compare the underlying model architectures ability to solve spatial tasks, not to compare quantizations of a model not SFTd with these tokens.

But I dunno, maybe it is useful?
