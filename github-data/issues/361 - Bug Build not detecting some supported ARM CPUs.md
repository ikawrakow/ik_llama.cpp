## ðŸ“„ Description

### What happened?

This was reported in [#345](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/345) and I was also able to reproduce it on an Android device, there is a workaround with [#347](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/347) but ideally you should not need to set the architecture flag manually. This does not seem to affect the Apple ARM devices.

We can add something along the lines of mainline's automatic CPU feature detection. But I also have the experience that since they added the feature, mainline runs slower on my M2-Max CPU as it enables the `i8mm` CPU feature, but my guess is that this is emulated and not an actual feature of the M2 CPU.

Yes, I just created the issue since I hadn't looked into it fully.

That aligns with what was reported in [#345](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/345) where the user had better performance with `-march=armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16+noi8mm+nosve+nosme` over just `"-march=armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16"`. So it may not be just the M2 CPU. I'm not very familiar with the actual hardware implementation of the recent ARM extensions so I can't really say.
