That's funny, I was just trying the same thing tonight and noticed the same thing!

Sorry, there is no vision support in `ik_llama.cpp` at all. As I know nothing about vision or multi-modality, my suggestion is to try to convince @ngxson to contribute the multi-modality library he created for `llama.cpp` also to `ik_llama.cpp`.

I think I'll close this one. A feature request can be opened instead.
