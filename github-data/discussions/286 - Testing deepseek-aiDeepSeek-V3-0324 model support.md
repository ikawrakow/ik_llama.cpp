## 📄 Description

I saw today a new model [deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324) that may run on this fork?

Zero pressure for anyone to spend time on this, just experimenting to satisfy my curiosity.

I figure might as well download it and see if it magically "just works" using my [existing R1 custom quant procedure](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/258).

The main two issues I imagine might crop up without knowing anything:
* Might need a special imatrix file (maybe [this one from mradermacher](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/DeepSeek-V3-i1-GGUF/resolve/main/imatrix.dat) for earlier V3 will still work?)
* 14B of the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) Module weights

> 5.4.3. Multi-Token Prediction Evaluation
Instead of predicting just the next single token, DeepSeek-V3 predicts the next 2 tokens through
the MTP technique. Combined with the framework of speculative decoding (Leviathan et al.,
2023; Xia et al., 2023), it can significantly accelerate the decoding speed of the model. A natural
question arises concerning the acceptance rate of the additionally predicted token. Based on
our evaluation, the acceptance rate of the second token prediction ranges between 85% and 90%
across various generation topics, demonstrating consistent reliability. This high acceptance rate
enables DeepSeek-V3 to achieve a significantly improved decoding speed, delivering 1.8 times
TPS (Tokens Per Second). -https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.19437

Well, I'll update this discussion after it finishes downloading and I give it the old college try haha...

Curious if anyone else has any luck and if this new model is "better" at coding like some are speculating over on [r/LocalLlama](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1jisuq4/deepseek_v30324_has_caught_up_to_sonnet_37_in_my/)... Who knows!

The config.json is the same (same architecture/same config) so ik_llama.cpp will behave the same (besides the updated weights, which affect output). This is just another finetune. 

There are cases where finetuned model does change the config (see Qwen with the base being 128K , and the instruct tunes being only 32k with them recommending: "To handle extensive inputs exceeding 32,768 tokens, we utilize [YaRN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071), a technique for enhancing model length extrapolation, ensuring optimal performance on lengthy texts.", but this is not one of those cases, and even in that cases the finetune did not change the architecture (which is what matters for conversion) just config.

For the first point, the linked imatrix will work but I do not recommended it as even though that imatrix was generated on the same model type and so it will apply, the model weights are different and that affects the imatrix data. (Edit: The mradermacher team is already working on quanting and imatrixing that model)

The second point, those weights were present in the other releases such as V3, V3-BASE, and R1, and the conversion just does not include them as llama.cpp and ik_llama.cpp both have do not support the MTP, it is a similar situation with what happened with the MLA tensors, where once support was added the conversion script was updated to include them which required reconverting.

I'm curious, and will have to make room for it on my server. I know this is slightly off topic but I'd be curious to hear your experience with this (and any of the other Deepseek models you've tried).

I'm only now experimenting with using longer context ~30-40k by copy pasting in code, man pages, documentation, etc.  Using R1 at `Q4` today I was trying to understand how to potentially have `llm_load_tensors()` allocate N copies of ctx_buffs (one on each N NUMA nodes). It helped me understand a bit more the relationship between `src/llama.cpp` and `ggml/src/ggml-backend.c`, but didn't give magic working code haha... It did help me update `CMakeLists.txt` to get it building linking with libnuma library. I've also had some luck with it refactoring python code especially creating uniform style comments and adding static typing. Even QwQ-32B could write a decent 1-shot flappy bird when given a detailed prompt to follow haha...

> Have you decided on a calibration dataset? The discussions  [here](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/185#issuecomment-2640263710) and [here](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/140#discussioncomment-12126789) on the nature of an MoE  model and size of the calibration dataset might be interesting to you, this was also discussed by the mradermacher team [here](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/BabyHercules-4x150M-GGUF/discussions/3#6758d52499eea0c4b65d0475) [I think there may be other times I've seen it discussed, but don't recall exactly where so that I can link them to you]). I know bartowski's calibration dataset is public, but the longer team mradermacher dataset is not (but they do proactively imatrix a lot of quants, and I've never seen them deny a request to imatrix a model, so it not being public doesn't matter as much).
> 
> Also this https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/250 if you haven't seen it is obviously relevant to you, (team mradermacher use a very lightly modified llama.cpp and not ik_llama.cpp).
> 
> The time it takes is obviously dependent on your hardware, I know for team mradermacher it takes them around 20 hours for these large Deepseek models but their situation is FAR from ideal (which is just another reason why I'm so grateful for them). They RPC multiple machines together, and also have to enable GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY and they state "Keep in mind that half the performance is lost due to using GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1 while allocating memory far larger than the available GPU memory instead of -ngl 0 duetoi (sic) this not beeing (sic) supported for RPC servers."

> 
> I don't remember exactly how much I used V3, but I know I very briefly tried V3-Base and it catastrophically failed a test prompt I'd given it, and had no desire to use it ever since, V3 I remember trying more, but wasn't really impressed and with how slow inference of it was at the time for me, it felt like for creative tasks it was just a worse Mistral Large 2407 (both sharing similar tradeoffs of being really intelligent with good prompt following but very dry and boring).

I still will probably use the mradermacher one, ~~but yours will have the additional MLA tensor which I might be able to merge into theirs~~, but it would be fun to size golf the smallest functional Deepseek model and see how much the quality of the imatrix matters on a model that small.

I really like the model, but reading their papers they have done an amazing job at optimizations when it comes to get the most out of the hardware and on the choices of model architecture (MLA, MoE with a good amount of experts [I can't say it's a lot when [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04153) exists], a shared expert [qwen 3 seems to be dropping this for their MoE which is interesting], etc.) , but the actual RL tuning seems like there are a LOT of low hanging fruit and obvious and large improvements that can be done.

Could leave imatrix running probably if there is a special llama fork to use as you referenced or if the input file is not enough chunks to give the ~1GiB dat file (tbh I'm just learning how it even works so just winging it lol).

I do think the difference is minimal (unless a catastrophic failure occurs but that would require a smaller dataset than yours).

As @saood06 pointed out, `Q8_0` is good enough to collect imatrix data. 

> Also this https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/250 if you haven't seen it is obviously relevant to you,

This has been superseded by [#259](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/259). The additional 2 tensors needed for MLA (`attn_k_b` and `attn_v_b`) are computed on the fly from `attn_kv_b` when loading the model (if missing). So, the best strategy is to use standard attention for imatrix calculations, which will give imatrix data to `attn_kv_b`, so this tensor will get a better quantization. `attn_k_b` is a transposed version of half of `attn_kv_b`. It gets computed by converting `attn_kv_b` to `fp32`, transposing that, and then quantizing to `Q8_0`, so (nearly) lossless. `attn_v_b` is just a view of the other half of `attn_kv_b`, so it uses the `attn_kv_b` data directly.

If you don't get NaNs, it is somehow related to `Q8_0_R8`, and you can keep going with `ik_llama.cpp`. If you do get NaNs, you can stop it and use mainline.

> Ah, it is a MoE model with 256 experts. Batches of 512 result in many experts doing multiplication with just a handful of rows. So, I guess, there will be a larger penalty due to memory access patterns. Still, I don't expect it to be slower than 1 socket. Or?

Thanks, I'll try that quick while also copying over another mainline `q8_0` for insurance haha...

And right looks like `q6_k` for `ffn_down.weight` in the first 3 dense layers and `ffn_down_shexp.weight` shared experts is a good place to start trimming a bit.

> I use a small custom python chat client that uses `litellm` to hit the OpenAI API chat endpoint. The first time i forgot and left it at R1 default of `0.6` which possibly had some funky code generation or my terminal got borked. I set it to `0.3` and re-ran while not resizing my terminal and things looks good. The only things I ever specify are `top_p=0.95` and `temperature` as mentioned above. I generally keep it simple for coding generations.

> In the past I have played with samplers more, especially when trying to reduce slop and increase creativity in writing. I would increase temperature, adjust `top_p`, `min_p`, `top_k`, and even played around a bit with the more specialized samplers like [xtc](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md#xtc-sampling). Anymore I haven't fussed with it much, and spend more time adding variance into the prompt like example clips etc.

And right looks like `q6_k` for `ffn_down.weight` in the first 3 dense layers and `ffn_down_shexp.weight` shared experts is a good place to start trimming a bit.

I would increase temperature, adjust `top_p`, `min_p`, `top_k`, and even played around a bit with the more specialized samplers like [xtc](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md#xtc-sampling). Anymore I haven't fussed with it much, and spend more time adding variance into the prompt like example clips etc.

> Oh nice, a single html sounds cool. I want to re-write my little `dchat.py` app to remove litellm dependency and simply use async http directly as it is such a thin layer and I would prefer to have more transparency. It uses a simple status bar `enlighten` and `deepseek-tokenizer` to dynamically update tok/sec estimate on the client using async streaming response. I'd like to add [primp](https://github.com/deedy5/primp) directly to it, which I use for my "agentic" stuff like web search and scraping - it delivers fairly clean markdown ready to feed to LLMs.

@ubergarm 

Just saw this "In our web and application environments, the temperature parameter $T_{model}$ is set to 0.3. " and they even go as far to encourage users to use that by "Thus, if you call V3 via API, temperature 1.0 equals to the model temperature 0.3.", so I think you might want to experiment with that temperature.

@ikawrakow 

Is this something you have looked into? I think even a basic implementation should offer 50% improvement.

There is also jukofyork who is making draft model's (see [here](https://huggingface.co/jukofyork/DeepSeek-R1-DRAFT-0.5B-GGUF)) that can be used with llama.cpp's already existing generic drafting implementation, I'm watching that to see how much performance uplift people end up reporting on that.

The imatrix computation that gave these final perplexity values is useless. It means mainline is not working with `Q8_0` either for DeepSeek-V3 (the difference between a NaN PPL and a PPL of 6 million is marginal, if any).

> Thanks, I would have used your imatrix over bartowski as I think your dataset is better, but I just finished up the quant and don't feel like making another. Once team mradermacher uploads one I may end up making additional quants using both theirs and yours.
> 
> Also the forum link on your huggingface readme from L1T caught my eye, I used to hang around there a good amount, haven't in a while, I should go back.

I've seen folks anecdotally suggesting `V3-0324` hallucinates more but might just be the default temps are too high, not sure.
