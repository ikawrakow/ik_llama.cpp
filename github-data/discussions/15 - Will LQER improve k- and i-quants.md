## üìÑ Description

[LQER/L¬≤QER](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02446) is the latest hype about LLM quantization. Promptly, there is an [issue](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/8831) in `llama.cpp` to use that to improve the existing quantization methods because, you know, the gras is always greener on the other side of the road. But, unlike many earlier calls to improve quantization with the latest "SOTA" quantization advertisement, err, scientific paper, on arXiv, there are already efforts underway to actually implement this. E.g., [this PR](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/8939) adds Numpy dequantization so one can use Numpy to do the SVD of the difference between the full model and a quantized model.

People are of course free to spend their energy any way they see fit, and I should rather mind my own business, but I couldn't help myself but put this prediction on the record:

**LQER/L¬≤QER will not help to improve any of the k- or I-quants in `llama.cpp`.**

Why do I think so?

Having spent so much time on developing all k- and i-quants in `llama.cpp`, I basically remember perplexity (PPL) values for a lot of models, especially the early once such as LLaMA-v1 and LLaMA-v2. And these are exactly the models the LQER authors compare their quantization against in Table 3 of the paper. So, for me, just a quick look was sufficient to see that the results of the paper are nowhere near being SOTA as they are being advertised. But let's do the comparison. I reproduce the Table 3.1 here for convenience:
 
<img width="1561" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-09 at 1 39 34 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92f1e85f-83a8-4f51-bc6a-0f7ebfeb21d8">

Activation quantization is not quite there yet in `llama.cpp`, so we will focus on the upper part of the table, which shows results when only the model weights are quantized. Let us do some comparisons. I'll use `Q4_K_S`, `IQ4_XS`, and the newly added `IQ4_K` and `IQ3_K`. The L¬≤QER quantization is 4.3 bpw, so it is in the same range as `IQ3_XS` (4.25 bpw) and `Q4_K_S/IQ4_K` (4.5 bpw). `IQ3_K` (3.4 bpw) is there to put things into perspective.

I have archived my LLaMA-v1 models and didn't feel like restoring (or re-downloading) the 33B and 65B models, so we will look at 7B and 13B. The PPL results in the paper are computed with standard Python tooling, and it is known that perplexities computed with `llama.cpp` can be quite different from people get in the Python Universe. But the ratio of the quantized PPL to the PPL of the `f16` model is nearly independent of the way PPL has been computed. The authors of the LQER paper have chosen to use the difference `PPL(Q) - PPL(f16)` (the ‚àÜPPL column in Table 3), which is basically the same thing. Nevertheless, let's put some effort into making `llama.cpp` PPL more comparable to Python tooling. As far as I can tell, there are two main differences how PPL is computed:
* In `llama.cpp` PPL is evaluated by sequentially going over the provided evaluation text, while in Python samples of the given context length are selected at random. This should not result in a different result, at least not beyond the statistical uncertainty of the PPL estimate, so I did not change `llama.cpp`. 
* In `llama.cpp` the mean log probability is evaluated over the second half of the context window `n_ctx`, while in Python the whole context window is used. Both are approximations to PPL for a context `n_ctx`. The `llama.cpp` approximation is better (to first order, it reports PPL for `3/4 n_ctx`, while the Python estimate is for `1/2 n_ctx`. Nevertheless, let's just change it in `llama.cpp` by adjusting [this line](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/blob/a9f302ebe2373321c12b01d8760904901aa064a4/examples/perplexity/perplexity.cpp#L567). But instead of just using `first = 1`, I adjusted a bit around and ended up using `first = std::max(1, n_ctx/128)`, which gave the closest match between `llama.cpp` and the values reported in Table 3 of the LQER paper (which are for a context of 2048. I know this based on other quantization papers, which quote the same `f16` `PPL` values and explicitly state the context window used)

The following table shows the `llama.cpp` `f16` perplexities for the full models computed with this modification:

|  LLaMA-v1-7B | LLaMA-v1-13B | LLaMA-v2-7B | LLaMA-v2-13B |
| -------------- | --------------  | -------------- | --------------- |
|  5.6291 +/- 0.02202 | 5.0172 +/- 0.01893 | 5.4802 +/- 0.02128  |   4.8706 +/- 0.01824 |

OK, we can now do the comparison. The table shows  ‚àÜPPL for the 4 LLaMA models and the 4 different quantization types. For more convenient comparison I have also added the  L¬≤QER result.  

| Quantization |  bpw | LLaMA-v1-7B | LLaMA-v1-13B | LLaMA-v2-7B | LLaMA-v2-13B |
| ------- | ----- | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| L¬≤QER            |  4.30 | 0.220 |  0.100  | 0.100 | 0.060 |
| IQ3_K           |  3.43 | 0.220 |   0.142  | 0.114 | 0.144 | 
| IQ4_XS         |  4.25 | 0.075 |  0.054  | 0.065 | 0.048 |
| Q4_K_S        |  4.50 | 0.065 | 0.041  | 0.063 | 0.044 |
| IQ4_K           |  4.50 | 0.041  | 0.033  | 0.043 | 0.034 |

I think the difference in performance is clear, and no further discussion is required.

I made [this comment](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/729#issuecomment-1519038289) back in April of 2023. I had just gotten involved with `llama.cpp` and had started thinking about the quantization of LLMs. With SVD being a standard tool in the toolbox of an ML practitioner, it was one of the first things that came to mind. Did I try? Of course I did - with disappointing results: one needed way too many terms to be competitive with block-wise quantization (I had already started working on k-quants). It is of course possible that my SVD attempts weren't good and, and the LQER authors were able to get something out of SVD. But my guess is it is a matter of the quality of the quantization to begin with: if the quality is low, then perhaps one can improve with just the first few components of the singular value decomposition. But if one still has a 2X - 5X larger quantization error **after** having done that, it is extremely unlikely that one can improve the much better quants by using just a few SVD terms. So, based on this, I reach the above conclusion.

Pinging @compilade who seems to be the main driving force behind implementing LQER in `llama.cpp` just in case this is somehow useful.

Thanks for pinging me, it's interesting to learn about your past attempts with SVD.

In the LQER paper they don't seem to use it on top of SOTA quantization methods (they seem to use it on top of MXINT), so I'm simply curious to see if it's viable to apply it on top of k-quants and i-quants.

It might not be worth it, though, as you say.

But there's also something else which they did not try in the paper: subtracting a low-rank decomposition of the weights to then quantize only what remains, while the LoRA adapter of the quantization error should be able to recover it. I did not yet experiment with different ranks for both of theses low-rank approximations.

And in my preliminary tests this *does* help with pure `Q2_K` compared to plain LQER, but wasn't really better than the default `Q2_K` mix (which also uses `Q3_K` in some places), at least on a small model (OpenELM-270M), and with F16 LoRA and a rank of 32.

It's possible that a specialized quantization type for the not-low-rank part of weights could be useful, but I did not yet study how the distribution is changed when subtracting a low-rank approximation. My hypothesis is that non-linear assymetric quant types have an advantage for this, so the new `IQ2_K` and `IQ3_K` *might* be well suited for this.

I did not yet implement L¬≤QER, so I dont know how it would perform yet. You're likely very right that it won't be good, but I want to try, because it will enable other experiments like different error-minimization objectives for the quantized dense tensor and the low-rank adapter.

Also, I have not yet implemented Numpy dequantization for most of the `IQ` types, only `IQ4_NL` and `IQ4_XS`, because the grids for the others are a bit large. Ideally, they should be generated at runtime with a minimal amount of magic numbers. Is that possible?

Perhaps you should ask Georgi? According to `git blame` he is the author of most of the `IQ` tables.

But more seriously: the short answer is 'no'. To generate these tables, I quantized a bunch of models using the full E8 or D4 lattice, and collected statistics how often each lattice point is being used. This data is already orders of magnitude larger than the final `IQ` tables (and it takes quite some tome to generate). I then ran an optimization that attempts to a) Maximize the use count of selected lattice points and b) Minimize the maximum (or count averaged) distance between not selected lattice points to the nearest selected lattice point. I haven't published the code that does these things. But even if I had, the run time of the optimization is much too long to be invoked each time (and the lattice point use statistics is much bigger than the tables). I'm also not sure why you think the tables are too large? The data fits in L1 cache, no? Or are we running this on computers with 16 kB of RAM?

> And in my preliminary tests this does help with pure Q2_K compared to plain LQER, but wasn't really better than the default Q2_K mix (which also uses Q3_K in some places), at least on a small model (OpenELM-270M), and with F16 LoRA and a rank of 32.

If you use enough principle components you will eventually get an improvement, of course. But the question is, given the extra bits spent, is the improvement better than what is achievable by using a different quant, using quantization mixes, etc., with the same extra bits spent. Also, as demonstrated by `IQ2_S` (and `IQ2_K` in this repo), `Q2_K` is far from optimal in terms of the compromise between quantization accuracy and quantized model size, so perhaps one could get something there.

> But there's also something else which they did not try in the paper: subtracting a low-rank decomposition of the weights to then quantize only what remains, while the LoRA adapter of the quantization error should be able to recover it. I did not yet experiment with different ranks for both of theses low-rank approximations.

This is the first thing I tried. If that had been successful, we would have gotten not just a model compression, but a massive increase in performance too as matrix multiplications with a low rank decomposition are much faster than using the full matrix. I did have moderate success with the `K` and `Q` tensors in the early layers of LLaMA-1, but anything else was just hopeless until you started approaching full SVD.

But then again, I'm one of those people suffering from the NIH syndrome, so used my own hand-rolled tools for this investigation. Perhaps you will be more lucky just using standard tooling.

Btw, on [this branch](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/tree/ik/try_svd) there is some exploration of using SVD before or after the quantization. I have misused the `quantize-stats` tool to look at how the root-mean-square-error (rmse) behaves as a function of the number of SVD components. One can do the SVD before or after quantization. Certainly not production quality, AVX2-only vectorization, very simple multi-threading, but still enough to see that SVD does not add any value to LLMs quantization when the quantization works reasonably well. I know it works because full SVD reduces rmse to zero.

Still feels like a good proof of concept, even though it doesn't test using SVD both before quantization (to remove low-rank components from the input) *and* after (to then correct both the additional low-rank error and the quantization error) at the same time. It's helpful to know that plain LQER is worse than better quantization.

@compilade With your PR-9400 in `llama.cpp` I now have to write GGUF loading and link against `ggml` when I want to take a quick look at an imatrix? Instead of just copy/pasting the 20 LOC of imatrix structure definition and (de-)serialization into a `.cpp` file and being done in 5 minutes? Ouch. And no, HF tools will with 99.99% probability not help me with what I'm interested in. I mean, having a Python imatrix to GGUF converter is I guess great for those who want to look at imatrix files on HF, but changing the imatrix tool to output GGUFs is a bit too much afaik.

Oh well, I'll need to keep my own copy of the `imatrix` and `quantize` tools.

We make a change that introduces headaches, triples or quadruples the code required to load/save such files thus magnifying the probability for bugs, and mandates linking against `libggml.so` for any tool that wants to operate with such files, to gain the benefit of "unifying file formats in llama.cpp"? Where the thing being unified is not some monstrous code with thousands of lines of code and massive maintenance burden but a 20 LOC thing that defines the format and implements (de-)serialization? Cool.

Would a reverse convert script, from new to old format help (round-trip conversion tests can be used to test for correctness), or do you categorically oppose using GGUF for `imatrix` files? Should `llama-quantize` be able to load both formats instead of only one?

@compilade Thank you for responding to my concerns.

> The main reason for it is that there doesn't seem to be a backward-compatible way to make the non-GGUF-based imatrix format work with many ubatches per chunk, or many chunks per ubatches (in the simple format, ncalls is tied to the ubatch size but is also somehow used as the number of chunks). 

I must admit I don't understand the concerns. The issue is that one cannot (correctly) combine imatrices computed with different `u_batch` sizes? (One can always combine them, but the files will not contribute to the combined imatrix with the correct weight). Why would one want to do that?  AFAIK, not needing to worry about batch and u-batch sizes is a feature, not a bug.

> It's also impossible to get the chunk size used to make a non-GGUF imatrix file from its metadata. (The convert script assumes 512 was used, but that's not always true. This is mostly relevant when merging imatrix files with --in-file)

Here is what I do
```
./bin/llama-imatrix -m some_model -f some+_training_data -c some_context --chunks N -o some_imatrix_c${some_context}.out
```
I.e., my imatrix files always carry the context length that was used in their name. Worth noting that a) The context length has a surprisingly small influence on the quantization results b) One may want to combine imatrices computed with a different context length to see what happens (what context length are you going to record for the combined imatrix file?)

> The non-GGUF imatrix files are simpler to deserialize, but that format has no way to be extended backward-compatibly, except by adding more stuff at the end and never ever removing any field. (And that format also doesn't have any magic number at the start, so not particularly easy to identify)

The imatrix is one and only one thing. I wouldn't know how one wants to "extend" it without it no longer being an imatrix. But suppose we **really** wanted to extend it. Here is what I would do
```
void read_imatrix(std::istream in, ...) {
    int  n_entries;
    VersionInfo vinfo = {}; // default constructor makes sure we are dealing with a "legacy" imatrix file.
    in.read((char *)&n_entries, sizeof(n_entries);
    if (n_entries == std::numeric_limits<int>::max()) {
        // imatrices with that many entries definitely do not exist
        // => we are dealing with an "extended" imatrix
        // read actual number of entries
        in.read((char *)&n_entries, sizeof(n_entries);
        // read version info
        read_version_info(vinfo);
    }
    ...
}
``` 
Voila, all existing imatrices continue to work, you can add whatever extensions you like (anywhere you like, not just at the end), we don't need to include `ggml/gguf` headers and link against a 370 MB `libggml.so`, etc.

This is what is done in the GGUF-based format. You're right that the chunk size in the metadata isn't really necessary. I *think* it would be possible to make it work that way in the simper format, but there would still be some weirdness with MoE tensors.

For example, I'm working on some kind `gguf-diff` tool which will compare tensors between GGUF files (dequantizing if necessary), and making `imatrix` data stored as GGUF would make that tool work on `imatrix` files too without having to specially handle them.

I will set <https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/9400> as a draft, and then I'll try to make a compromise by making `llama-imatrix` *both* able to output the simple (somewhat backward-compatibly, but by storing the number of tokens as `ncall` instead of the number of chunks (the division by `ncall` will still result in a mean (of squares), so your existing scripts *should* continue to work)) *and* GGUF-based format (so that bidirectional conversion will be directly possible with `--in-file`. The GGUF-based `imatrix` format would only be used when the `--output` ends with `.gguf`, which it will by default), while I'll also try to make `llama-quantize` read both (basically falling back when loading as GGUF fails).

> `imatrix.gguf` files can always be converted to the `imatrix.dat` format, but the reverse lacks some shape information for 3d tensor evaluation counts (which is necessary to handle partial data gracefully in stacked MoE tensors). Both directions still work, though. `llama-quantize` can read both formats.

Is it closer to "GGUF imatrix files should not exist", "GGUF imatrix should only be used deliberately" (e.g. by using the `.gguf` suffix), or "a format flag for the previous format would be enough, even if the default is GGUF"?
