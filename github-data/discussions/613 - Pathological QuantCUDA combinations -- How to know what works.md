## 📄 Description

Some quants/tensors seem to be incompatible with CUDA. My current example is a Q6_K (unsloth) quant of Kimi K2. If I leave all routed exp on CPU, I can get e.g. TG=~9tps. There's some VRAM remaining (RTX 8000, Turing, 48GB) so I can put a few e.g. up_exps on GPU. When doing this TG drops to 1tps or worse.

I've seen this phenomena before, trying to offload routed experts with some other quant types (w DeepSeek R1/V3) My understanding (I think somewhere @ubergarm explained it) is that some quants are not supported on CUDA and therefore must be converted before use **per token**.

PP throughput (~80tps) is not noticeably affected, presumably because of batching. (b=ub=4096)

Good outcome, ~9tps TG
```
-mla 2 -fa -fmoe
-b 4096 -ub 4096
-ctk f16 -c 64000
--n-gpu-layers 99
-ot exps=CPU
-op 26,0,27,0,29,0
-m /path/to/Kimi-K2-Instruct-Q6_K-00001-of-00018.gguf
```

if I change to 
```
-ot "blk\.(1|2|3|4|5|6)\.ffn_up.*=CUDA0"
-ot exps=CPU
```

TG drops to 1tps or worse.

Assuming the idea is correct, Q6_K is a pathological quant type (at least on Turing) -- how to know this? How can I know what my options are when building GGUFs that match my offload/cpu arrangement? 

edit: I shouldn't say they are not _supported_, but they aren't integrated into a kernel for the required op.

`Q6_K` has been around forever and hence is a well supported quant on all platforms. So, it is not that.

Instead, you absolutely do not want to split up `ffn_up` and `ffn_gate` when using `-fmoe`. Try
```
-ot "blk\.(1|2|3)\.ffn_up_exps=CUDA0,blk\.(1|2|3)\.ffn_gate_exps=CUDA0"
```
instead.

If you split `ffn_up` and `ffn_gate` and there is a fused `ffn_up/ffn_gate` op where `ffn_up` is on the GPU but `ffn_gate` is on the CPU, whatever the back-end decides to do (run the op on the GPU or the CPU), the tensors need to be copied from the GPU to the CPU or vice versa. This totally kills TG performance.

One more thing: if you have enough VRAM to use batch and u-batch of 4096, you should try removing `-op 26,0,27,0,29,0` to see how this affects your PP performance. Depending on GPU vs CPU speed, this may give you a non-negligible boost in PP performance for long prompts (longer than 4k tokens).
