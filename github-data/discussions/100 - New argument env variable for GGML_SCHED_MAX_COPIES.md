## 📄 Description

@ikawrakow, could you set up a CLI argument (or at least an env variable, it's much simpler I guess but I'm failing to do it right) to determine GGML_SCHED_MAX_COPIES without recompiling? It impacts VRAM occupation and performances, and it'd be great to set that up conveniently for benching and customized use.

I haven't looked into this at all. What is it good for?

It's supposed to go faster inference on multi-GPU I guess. Mainline sets it at 4, I set it at 1, because I didn't notice much improvement back in the days, but I noticed more vram consumption and gpu load.
