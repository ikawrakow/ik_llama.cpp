## 📄 Description

## Introduction

The Qwen3 models were officially released on 29th, April, 2025. This is a mixture-of-experts (MoE) models which 235B in total and 22B activated, here are the following features.

- Type: Causal Language Models
- Training Stage: Pretraining & Post-training
- Number of Parameters: 235B in total and 22B activated
- Number of Paramaters (Non-Embedding): 234B
- Number of Layers: 94
- Number of Attention Heads (GQA): 64 for Q and 4 for KV
- Number of Experts: 128
- Number of Activated Experts: 8
- Context Length: 32,768 natively and 131,072 tokens with YaRN.

The qwen3moe had supported in in PR [#355](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/355), I tried to run the biggest model [Qwen3-235B-A22B-128K-GGUF](https://hf-mirror.com/unsloth/Qwen3-235B-A22B-128K-GGUF) with ik_llama.cpp on my Workstation, I need better generation quality, an my system has sufficient memory(Total 512G RAM), so I chose the relatively higher quality quantization `Q8_0`.

## Profiler Data

I also use `Intel VTune Profiler 2025.0.1` capture some interesting data when running llama-server with `Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K-Q8_0`, I will show them as well.

Thank you for these results. Quite amazing that it works reasonably well on an almost 8 years old CPU!

I'm curious if you might get better performance by repacking the model (unlikely for TG, very likely for PP). You can repack either on the fly by adding `-rtr` to the command line, or offline like this
```
./bin/llama-quantize --repack $model $repacked_model q8_0_r8
```
This shouldn't take very long, even for the 235B model.

Another note: at least on the CPUs that I have available, one gets better performance using `q8_0` KV cache (add `-ctk q8_0 -ctv q8_0` to the command line). Not so much for short contexts, but quite noticeable for long contexts.

> Ok, Thanks for the info. I found that the memory bandwidth was not filled when I use vtune profiler analysis the memory access, Maybe numa system works in Linux better, I will try to use `numactl` changes the memory policy ([https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/1437](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/issues/1437)), and repack the model with `q8_0_r8`. I will see if I can do better yet however.

Note: when I run llama-server with `-fa` and `-rtr` parameter, the speed is a little faster than only use `-fa`, the prefill and decode are increased, That is a good beginning!

This grabbed my attention as I have never seen any significant difference between `f16` and `q8_0` KV cache (if anything, I would be more suspect towards `f16` because it can overflow, and I think there have been reports about that). So, being someone who does not take thinks for granted, I tried it myself.

### Attempt 1

* I saw Redditor is using a `Q4_K_M` model, so try a stock `Q4_K_M` quantization
* `f16` and `Q8_0` KV cache both fail in all 3 attempts
* `f16` and `q8_0` both at some point arrive at the correct conclusion that two characters in the encoded text correspond to a single letter, but both abandon the idea after some unsuccessful attempts
* `f16` and `q8_0` both enter into seemingly infinite loop of trying the same ideas again and again. Sometimes they stop and give an incorrect answer, sometimes they keep going until they run out of tokens (I gave a limit of 20k tokens)

### Attempt 2
* Quantize to stock `IQ4_K`
* 3 attempts with `f16` and 3 attempts with `q8_0`. Each attempt uses the same seed for `q8_0` and for `f16`, but there are 3 different seeds for the 3 attempts
* `f16`: 2 out of 3 correct. The failed attempt runs out of tokens. Correct, Correct, Incorrect
* `q8_0`: 2 out of 3 correct. The failed attempt comes back with an incorrect result after about 12k tokens. Correct, Incorrect, Correct
* Each run consumes a different amount of thinking tokens

Hence, I think that the outcome is largely determined by the quality of the quantized model and by some luck. We know that in a random process (as we have here) slight differences in the computed token probabilities can make the model go on a very different path, even if the same seed was used.

In my experience there are places where the "luck" of a single token selected by sane sampler settings does have an outsized impact on the internal world state, but often it doesn't with the model using different words or changing trivial things but otherwise staying on the same track. Either way for entire responses yes, there are often large variations between seeds and sampling parameters.

> For me, with Deepseek based models I tend to use f16 as I don't see the need to save the space and speed is very close between them, but with other models I do quantize the KV cache, so I was also really surprised by the thread I linked. One last thing I saw in there that I forgot to mention was him stating "I know but as a side test I tried also Roo Code that I could not get to use all the tools with KV cache Q8 and worked fine with F16." so I'm not sure why his experience shows such stark differences that I also have never really experienced.

Note: qwen3moe uses 8 experts by default. I found that we can speed up token generation(2.7 token/s->3.2 token/s) by reducing some experts used (from Top-8 to Top-6), without a significant drop in quality.

You cannot  compare `Q2_K` to `Q8_0` for TG, there is going to be a factor in the range of 3X difference. Her PP is for a short prompt, and we don't know if it was a single prompt of 165 tokens or 10 prompts with 16 tokens each.

Well, I use `-ser 4,1` parameter to improve token generation(TG) performance, now we can get ~4.1 token/s TG(< 4k context size), and the 
quality not declined too much. all right, I admit this is just my opinion. Others can offer their own opinions on this point...We don't know what will happen in complex tasks...
