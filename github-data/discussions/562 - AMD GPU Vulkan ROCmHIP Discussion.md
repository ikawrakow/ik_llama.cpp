## 📄 Description

## Background
I've been asked a few times now about AMD GPU support with ik's fork. I recently got access to an AMD RX 7900 XTX to try it out, and as discussed on [Issue 503](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/503#issuecomment-2953557243) the Vulkan and ROCm backends are *not* the focus of this fork hence limited support on AMD GPU hardware.

I'm starting this discussion to have a place to point folks who might be interested the current state AMD GPU backend support, and especially if they wanted to attempt updates and work on it at all.

## Current State
ik_llama.cpp actually *does* compile with Vulkan and can do some limited inferencing. As it is unmaintained, it is slower than mainline at the moment. However I couldn't get it to compile with ROCm/HIP support. I only tried the AMD official open source AMDVLK backend and not the community open source RADV backend.

There is a [good benchmarking discussion on mainline](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/10879#discussioncomment-13606581) maintained by @netrunnereve which was very helpful for establishing baseline expectations and trying to understand the various AMD GPU driver development environments.

## Benchmarks
I did a comparison between mainline llama.cpp and ik_llama.cpp at the given sha's for what I could get working.

## Methodology
To keep things somewhat consistent with the establish methodologies I used [TheBloke's now vintage Llama-2-7B at classic Q4_0 quantization](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b.Q4_0.gguf). The following is how compilation was done as well as running `llama-sweep-bench` with and without flash attention `-fa`:

### Compiling
```bash
# compile for Vulkan
cmake -B build -DGGML_HIP=OFF -DGGML_VULKAN=1 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release -j $(nproc)

# couldn't find a combination that worked below
# compile for ROCm/HIP
export HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang"
export HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -R)"
#cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=0 -DGGML_HIP=ON -DGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100 -DGGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=0 -DGGML_HIPBLAS=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100 -DGGML_HIP_ROCWMMA_FATTN=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release -j $(nproc)

```

#### sweep-bench
```bash
export model=/models/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF/llama-2-7b.Q4_0.gguf
# try with and without -fa
./build/bin/llama-sweep-bench \
  --model "$model" \
  -fa \
  -c 18432 \
  -ngl 99 \
  --warmup-batch \
  --threads 1
```

### Observations
1. Surprisingly Vulkan without FA managed to complete the benchmark and even give similar performance as mainline for the no FA token generation at longer context lengths.
2. However, Vulkan with FA enabled shows very poor performance and consistently crashes at `N_KV=7680`.  `iqk_fa_templates.h:1146: GGML_ASSERT(fms.S[j] > 0) failed`
3. I did *not* test any other quantizations especially the newer ik exclusive quants.
4. I did do a quick vibe check and confirm the model was at least valid tokens, however the chat template seemed odd or could be due to my client settings for temp etc but the responses seemed wrong and had `<|im_start|>` and `<|im_end|>` type tokens which don't usually come back from the chat endpoint.

## Conclusion
Well, sorry if you have AMD GPU hardware and were hoping to try out the latest greatest stuff on ik's fork. You can still make use of the CPU only optimizations fwiw. You can see the relative performance of native CUDA in the linked benchmark thread for one of my other tests, and ik's fork does run faster than mainline for CUDA.

Finally, I saw [and interesting NVIDIA slide deck from the Vulkanised 2025 Developer Conference](https://vulkan.org/user/pages/09.events/vulkanised-2025/T47-Jeff-Bolz-NVIDIA.pdf) which discusses llama.cpp on pages 14 and 15 even showing what looks like [some of ik's IQ4_NL code](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/5590) with implementation discussions. I was surprised that some models benchmark faster on NVIDIA GPUs using vulkan backend beating out the native CUDA implementation, but perhaps that is for another day...

Thanks and curious if anyone else has tried this or is interested in improving support here. Cheers!

llama.cpp's vulkan backend is faster and uses less memory on my 7900xtx as well (I'm using latest rocm on Arch so it's not that).

I'm working on bringing ik_llama.cpp up to date with llama.cpp's vulkan backend. It is actually easier than I expected.

> Vulkan also needs this one, but I couldn't port it in easily. The issue is vulkan does not have FUSED_RMS_NORM and FUSED_MUL_UNARY support, and when using RPC, it needs this. My current workaround is skip ggml_fused_rms_norm and ggml_fused_mul_unary when using vulkan.  @ikawrakow

So, what is the "approved" way of installing the necessary dependencies for Vulkan development on Ubuntu? I ended up installing LunarG VulkanSDK, but the thing almost bricked my system because I hadn't run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` before importing their repository and attempting to install. Is there a better way, preferably with just Ubuntu packages and no 3rd party stuff?

Anyhow, at the end I got the mainline Vulkan build working, but performance is very far from CUDA on my RTX-4080

So, PP is 3X lower, TG is 20-25% lower.

Given this, does it make sense to spend time on Vulkan? When I forked `llama.cpp` last year the Vulkan stuff was mostly a gimmick, with performance not much better than just running on a moderately fast CPU. They have done a lot of Vulkan development and performance improvements in mainline since then, but it still seems way too far behind.

@jeffbolznv  Thank you for chiming in. Above is the log. Is there something additional I need to do to improve performance? I did
```
mkdir vulkan && cd vulkan
cmake .. -DGGML_VULKAN=ON -DGGML_CUDA=OFF
make -j
```

What's the llama-bench equivalent of the `N_KV` column in that table? Is it `-d`? I see a big difference between coopmat1 and coopmat2 with large depth.

> I haven't looked into mainline `llama.cpp`, but the `sweep-bench` here adds `N_KV` tokens to the KV cache, and then runs a batch of a given size (1024 tokens in the above example), and generates a given number of new tokens (256 in the example). Time is measured for both, and resulting tokens/second is printed. The KV cache is increased gradually in a sweep, which corresponds to a typical experience of a user interacting with an LLM.  I don't know what the `-d` option in mainline does (I think it is a relatively recent addition), that's why I have a port of `sweep-bench` to mainline `llama.cpp` to be able to run direct (and more meaningful) comparisons than `-p 512` or `-n 128`).

> I see much better (>2x) performance for large KV with coopmat2, and I think this is because it's doing more rows at a time (64 vs 16). It might be possible to improve this for the coopmat1 path, but it may start running into register limits, hard to say. For an NV GPU, you should just update to a recent driver (r575) and you'll get the improved performance automatically.

I suspect the Vulkan driver still has some small launch overhead relative to CUDA that hurts at smaller sizes, but I'm not really sure.

The most efficient FA implementation requires k-head = 192, v-head = 128 for prompt processing, and k-head = 576, v-head = 512 for token generation.

I think this is what Johannes used for testing when he implemented the k-head-size != v-head-size FA in the `llama.cpp` CUDA backend. I did have a partial implementation here using this model quite a bit earlier than mainline (the part for k-head=192, v-head=128), but I was straggling to get a performant implementation for the k-head=576, v-head=512 case, so that's why I asked the question if there are principle issues with the Vulkan implementation.

But a port of the mainline Vulkan back-end to `ik_llama.cpp` without the additions that make `ik_llama.cpp` faster for CUDA and CPU inference has zero benefits. People can simply use `llama.cpp` with their AMD GPUs.

So, the Vulkan back-end is usable, and performance is better than `llama.cpp` (see, e.g., PR [#584](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/584) that has a comparison for a MoE model). But compared to CUDA on the same GPU, performance is much lower, especially for MoE models (and most users appear to be using `ik_llama.cpp` exactly for one of the giant MoE models). I have mixed feelings how to proceed:
* There is much more performance optimization potential in the Vulkan back-end compared to CUDA or CPU. So, from that point of view it seems worthwhile to put some effort into optimizing the Vulkan back-end
* I know nothing about Vulkan programming in general or the `llama.cpp` Vulkan back-end in particular, hence, at least initially, it will be an uphill battle. Without a significant interest from the user base, I don't feel particularly motivated to do this to myself.

So, if you feel that Vulkan performance improvement in `ik_llama.cpp` is important, go to discussion [#590](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/590) and vote!
