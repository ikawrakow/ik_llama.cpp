## üìÑ Description

just for convenience all subsequential commands to install bitnet (or other cpu models) on a fresh termux aarch64:
```bash
apt update && apt install wget cmake git -y
git clone https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp
cd ik_llama.cpp
cmake -B ./build -DGGML_CUDA=OFF -DGGML_BLAS=OFF -DGGML_ARCH_FLAGS="-march=armv8.2-a+dotprod+fp16" -DGGML_IQK_FLASH_ATTENTION=OFF
cmake --build ./build --config Release -j $(nproc)
wget https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf/resolve/main/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf?download=true -O ./models/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf
./build/bin/llama-quantize --allow-requantize ./models/ggml-model-i2_s.gguf ./models/bitnet.gguf iq2_bn_r4
./build/bin/llama-server -mla 3--model ./models/bitnet.gguf
```
the template for the model in chat prompt under 127.0.0.1:8080 should be
```
<|begin_of_text|>{{prompt}}<|eot_id|>
{{history}}
{{char}}:
```

thanks for the help @ikawrakow @RobertAgee @saood06 
edit: sometimes its producing  nonsense output
reverted to old prompt template

using the built in llama-server standard and pasting that in prompt template field to get correct chat format

{{history}}

Would love to try out an abliterated version and Falcon 3 to see if either of those would help it have a little more conversational flow.

Didn't work for me in my case. Stayed hung up at compilation forever

You can now disable building the templated flash attention (FA) kernels. Disabling FA should massively improve build times.

There is now PR [#435](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/435) that significantly reduces build time. I cannot test on Android myself, so would appreciate if someone did and reported
* New vs old build time (with CPU model)
* Does it still work correctly?
* Is the inference performance affected?
