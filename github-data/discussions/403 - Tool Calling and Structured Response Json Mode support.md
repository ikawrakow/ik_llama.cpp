## 📄 Description

Hey Team,

Amazing work here. as compared to llama.cpp the biggest feature that I see missing is support for tool calling. D oyou have any plans to include it in the future roadmap? Or am i missing something and it alredy exists?

I am forced to use other frameworks, even though i like inferencing speeds from ik_llama.cpp, just beacuse i cant live without these features and want to swap it out natively in the openai's python client in my project implementation. 

I know tha i can prompt the model in a particular way to force it to produce a json response. I am not looking for that.

Thank you in advance!

Hey @mtcl,

we are a very small team, so cannot do everything that `llama.cpp` does. Hence, the strategy is to focus on few things, but do these things really well.

Please enter a feature request in the Issues. I'll label it with "help wanted" and we will see what happens.
