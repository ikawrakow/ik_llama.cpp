## 📄 Description

A Microsoft team has released [CPU inference code](https://github.com/microsoft/BitNet) for 1.58-bit Bitnets. The repo, based 100% on `llama.cpp`, and only adding Bitnet CPU kernels (`ARM_NEON, AVX2`)  has 2.1k stars as of this writing. As per @Dampfinchen ["this is just insanity"](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/9945).

Well, here we have had Bitnet inference for while. For CPU and GPU. Faster than Microsoft's by quite some margin.

There is a screen recording in their repo demoing the 3.3B Bitnet model writing a 900 token essay and achieving 71 t/s on **M2 Ultra**.   Here is a screen recording from my **M2-Max laptop** (~1/2 the computing power and memory bandwidth of M2 Ultra) getting 74 t/s on the same prompt.

And here it is running on the M2-Max 30-core GPU

Finally, here running on RTX-4080


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e240fd80-9747-470f-8282-3f53bfacff4b

The prompt is very short (9 tokens), but it is still worth noting that Microsoft's implementation processes the prompt at a rate of 85 t/s, while here we get 157 t/s with half the computing power.

I was curious to see Microsoft's Bitnet performance on `X86_64`. So, cloned their repo and followed the setup instructions. The setup script  downloaded the `fp32` Bitnet-1.58-3B version, so 13.2 GB instead of 6.6. It also demands `clang-18`, so I had to install that first (even though `llama.cpp` definitely does not require `clang`, and even less `clang-18` to be built, and at a quick glance neither do the added ternary kernels). Their "end-to-end" test script `e2e_benchmark.py` does not do much more than just run the familiar `llama-bench`. Here is what I get on my Ryzen-7950X CPU

| model                          |       size |     params | backend    | threads |          test |                  t/s |
| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | ------: | ------------: | -------------------: |
| bitnet 3B I2_S - 2 bpw ternary | 873.66 MiB |     3.32 B | CPU        |      16 |         pp512 |         28.19 ± 0.12 |
| bitnet 3B I2_S - 2 bpw ternary | 873.66 MiB |     3.32 B | CPU        |      16 |         tg128 |         20.84 ± 0.03 |

The script warns that this is a debug build, but going to the `build` folder and checking shows that, nope, it is a release build. 28 t/s for PP-512 on a 3B ternary model? Hahaha.

Here is what I get with this repo:
| model                          |       size |     params | backend    | threads |          test |              t/s |
| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | ------: | ------------: | ---------------: |
| bitnet 3B IQ2_BN - 2.00 bpw Bitnet | 977.42 MiB |     3.43 B | CPU        |      16 |         pp512 |    620.63 ± 3.16 |
| bitnet 3B IQ2_BN - 2.00 bpw Bitnet | 977.42 MiB |     3.43 B | CPU        |       4 |         tg128 |     56.27 ± 0.27 |


22X (!!!) difference in prompt processing speed.  2.8X difference in token generation (TG) speed. TG is memory bound, so let's check what we get with just 1 thread. First theirs (be patient if you try it):

| model                          |       size |     params | backend    | threads |          test |                  t/s |
| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | ------: | ------------: | -------------------: |
| bitnet 3B I2_S - 2 bpw ternary | 873.66 MiB |     3.32 B | CPU        |       1 |         tg128 |          2.01 ± 0.01 |

Then ours

| model                          |       size |     params | backend    | threads |          test |              t/s |
| ------------------------------ | ---------: | ---------: | ---------- | ------: | ------------: | ---------------: |
| bitnet 3B IQ2_BN - 2.00 bpw Bitnet | 977.42 MiB |     3.43 B | CPU        |       1 |         tg128 |     25.72 ± 0.11 |

Aha. 12.8X.

Perhaps they did not turn on `AVX2/AVX512` while building? Let's try this
```

```

Oops. `AVX2` and `AVX512` are both on, and we get gibberish.  

Perhaps `clang` is mis-compiling the code? Or maybe something went wrong with the `clang-18` installation? Let's try `GCC`.
```
mkdir build1 && cd build1

```
Arghh. Comment out the `clang` check in `src/CMakeLists.txt` and retry. Now it builds successfully after
```
cmake ..
make -j
```

Running `llama-cli` gives much better performance - 52 t/s - but still gibberish output. PP-512 is also much better - 300 t/s. That's what I would expect from a run-of-the-mill `AVX2/AVX512` implementation. Still very far from being competitive.

OK, here is apples-to-apples performance comparison on my M2-Max laptop between Microsoft's `I2_S` and `IQ2_BN` here. I used their `generate-dummy-bitnet-model.py` tool to generate fake Bitnet models of different sizes and ran `llama-bench`. Did not go beyond 30B because generating the 30B model almost exhausted my patience. Their code crashes with segmentation fault on PP-512 tests, so just TG-128.

| Model | t/s (MS I2_S) | t/s (IQ2_BN)   | Speedup |
| ----- | ------------: | -------------: | ------: |
| 125M  |  639.39 ± 10.74 | 947.67 ± 34.86 | 1.482 |
| 350M  |  286.92 ± 1.35  | 426.03 ± 6.64  | 1.485 |
| 1B    |  144.62 ± 3.96  | 225.76 ± 7.70  | 1.561 |
| 1.5B  |  120.12 ± 1.31  | 170.55 ± 8.35  | 1.420 |
| 2.7B  |   84.25 ± 0.43  | 115.52 ± 3.13  | 1.371 |
| 3.8B  |   64.74 ± 0.22  |  86.58 ± 2.83  | 1.337 |
| 7B    |   39.14 ± 0.67  |  51.37 ± 0.82  | 1.312 |
| 13B   |   24.04 ± 0.03  |  30.21 ± 0.18  | 1.257 |   
| 30B   |   11.22 ± 0.05  |  13.57 ± 0.03  | 1.209 |  

The difference in performance decreases with model size, but that's just a matter of memory bandwidth saturation for `IQ2_BN`. The 30B model is 7.45 GiB, so at 13.6 t/s this is 101 GiB/s to fetch the model weights from RAM, which is basically as good as it gets on the M2-Max CPU.

Unfortunately only about 100 GB/s are given to the CPU, the other 300 GB/s are reserved for the GPU (but there are model/quant combinations where I can get up to 110-115 GB/s running CPU-only). As a result the M2-Max has a much better TG performance than a consumer level `x86_64` CPU - nearly twice the TG performance of the Ryzen-7950X. Another interesting thing about the M2-Max is that the silicon spent on the GPU is basically a waste. If it had been spent to double the number of CPU cores, and all of the 400 GB/s had been given to the CPU, that hypothetical CPU would be wiping the floor with the Apple GPU (well, at least for TG, PP would be still 2X lower than the GPU).

We are interested in getting some data to the CPU and actually doing something with it.  Here the M2-Max CPU maxes out at 110-115 GB/s, being around 100 GB/s most of the time. For PP I get about 2 TFLOPS out of the M2-Max CPU, so that's 250 GB/s of multiply-add processing power (fused multiply-add counting as 2 ops and needing 4 bytes of data per op), so processing power is not what limit us to ~100 GB/s in TG.

They updated the repo with the first Official model (all previous models were just supported models, and had far less training) https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T it looks competitive at it's size as it was trained with 4T tokens.
