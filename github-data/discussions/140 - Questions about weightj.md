## 📄 Description

Hi @ikawrakow, your work on quantization is amazing and I really admire them. Recently, I am reading codes about this and have some questions. 
For example, at funtion `quantize_row_q4_0_impl` and other places,  `weight[j]` is: 
```cpp
weight[j] = qw[j] * sqrtf(sigma2 + xb[j]*xb[j]);
```
I already see some discussions at [here](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/5263#discussioncomment-11511794), but  I still don't quite understand, Can you give me some guidance? Why do not use the following directly?
```cpp
weight[j] = qw[j]
```

Hi @DavidZyy,

this is simply an empirical correction, there is no science behind it (and it was amusing to observe people trying to make scientific sense out of it). From the pre-imatrix days we have learned that it is better to assign higher weights (importance) to model weights with larger magnitudes in a weighted RMSE minimization. As there is no precise science behind that, it was just a matter of experimentation to determine how this higher importance should look like ($x^2$, $|x|$, $\sigma^2 + x^2$, $\sigma + |x|$, etc., are all variations that have been tried). When I introduced the imatrix, the hope was of course that one can get rid of such non-scientific stuff and just use the diagonal elements of the Hessian. But in practice it is rarely as simple as that. Having the $\sqrt{\sigma^2 + x^2}$ in there does improve quantization accuracy, at least as measured by perplexity or KL-divergence.

Why $\sqrt{\sigma^2 + x^2}$ and not something else?
* As the Hessian already gives a lot of information about model weight importance, at some level it should be clear that the empirical correction cannot be as strongly magnitude dependent as it was without the imatrix
* We definitely do not want to have the importance of small-magnitude weights become (nearly) zero
* Based on the above two bullet points, and the experience from pre-imatrix quantization, $\sqrt{\sigma^2 + x^2}$ was an obvious choice that turned out to work better than anything else I tried

Why the need for correcting the Hessian in the first place?
* We are using just the diagonal elements, which is an approximation. In my experience adding a correction to an approximation often improves things
* From a more conceptual point of view, even if we did use the full Hessian, we still don't know if RMSE between the quantized and the full model weights is the similarity measure that we should be minimizing. RMSE is of course very convenient (expressions are very simple), so not knowing what to minimize we just use that. But in reality another similarity measure may be better, and it will have a different Hessian, so a different importance matrix, so we are back to square one where the importances being used are just a matter of empirical experimentation.

Thanks for taking time to answer this question and share information, I learned a lot from your answers.
Yes, it's very interesting :)

Oh shit, I just realised I totally forgot to reply to this post! @ikawrakow Thanks for the explanation!

FWIW, I actually tested a couple of different schemes that were more grounded in regularisation theory, but they performed worse than your empirical method. It would still be nice to find some way to interpolate between the two extremes; the recent 256-expert being a good case in point!

I did manage to fix some of this back when `dbrx` first dropped:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/7099

IIRC, all the main discussion is in this PR:

https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/6387#issuecomment-2094926182

but I still suspect that for these new very-high-expert-MoEs it should really be down-regularised compared to non-MoE or older low-expert-count-MoEs.

@jukofyork So, I have used regularization in a variety of contexts. Sadly, having spent the better part of my career in Medical Device where everything is closed source, there aren't many examples of that in the open. [This repository](https://github.com/ikawrakow/mnist) uses Tikhonov regularization for the training of an SVM model to recognize hand written digits. I put it out there because I find it funny that with fewer lines of code I can beet the [ggml mnist example](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml/tree/master/examples/mnist) by a huge margin (0.4% vs 2% error rate, so 5X lower). But having used ragularization techniques in deformable image registration, large scale optimization of radiation therapy treatments, real-time target and/or critical organ tracking on live MRI images, MR and PET image reconstruction, etc., I think I know quite well when regularization is required, and LLM quantization is not one of the cases where it is, at least not in the classical sense of adding penalty term(s) to the optimization objective. For instance, Tikhonov regularization that was being proposed in one of the discussions, is pretty much the last thing we want to do when quantizing because we definitely do not want to make the quantized values as small as possible, which is the goal of the Tikhonov regularization term. At some level, one can consider i-quants as using "regularization" via forcing groups of quants to fall on a finite set of grid points, the set being much smaller than all possible grid points for the given number of bits per quant. E.g., `IQ2_XXS` uses 256 out of 6561 points on the E8 lattice. This prevents overfitting, thus can be considered as "regularization". 

The other thing I have learned is that theories are rarely useful in their pure form. More often than not, you start with this beautiful theory to only find that it does not work very well in practice. So, you start adding fudge factors, and things get better. And then you add even more fudge factors and it gets better. When you are done with it you have something that works really well, but you barely recognize the beautiful pure theory you started from.

Just my 2 cents

Released in January 2011 in Japan , it is the third game in the Valkyria series . Employing the same fusion of tactical and real @-@ time gameplay as its predecessors , the story runs parallel to the first game and follows the " Nameless " , a penal military unit serving the nation of Gallia during the Second Europan War who perform secret black operations and are pitted against the Imperial unit " Calamaty Raven " . 
>  The game began development in 2010 , carrying over a large portion of the work done on Valkyria Chronicles II . While it retained the standard features of the series , it also underwent multiple adjustments , such as making the game more forgiving for series newcomers . Character designer Raita Honjou and composer Hitoshi Sakimoto both returned from previous entries , along with Valkyria Chronicles II director Takeshi Ozawa . A large team of writers handled the script . The game 's opening theme was sung by May 'n . 
>  It met with positive sales in Japan , and was praised by both Japanese and western critics . After release , it received downloadable content , along with an expanded edition in November of that year . It was also adapted into manga and an original video animation series . Due to low sales of Valkyria Chronicles II , Valkyria Chronicles III was not localized , but a fan translation compatible with the game 's expanded edition was released in 2014 . Media.Vision would return to the franchise with the development of Valkyria : Azure Revolution for the PlayStation 4 .

> There is some discussion among a huggingface quant maker about imatrixing arctic-instruct ( another large MoE), where they talked about how since the experts are stored together in one tensor if for a layer only 1 expert is missing the entire layer can't be quantized, also while investigating this trying to get that expert to activate they observation something that shows size alone doesn't matter as the diversity of data did.

> "the only ones that has 127 out of 128 experts other than yours was "calibration_datav3" from bartowski and " imatrix-with-rp-format-data". Many datasets got way less experts than that. It clearly is the quality of training data and not the amount that matters. 4chan pol_062016-112019_labeled is massive but when I aborted it, it only had 122 out of 128 experts on layer 0. MMLU which I though is really diverse only managed to trigger 121 out of 121 experts on layer 0. "Tech-Awesome-Hub/mix-data" was with just 120 out of 128 experts on layer 0 even worse than that."

> Yes, people are aware of that (not sure if these people are) since I've seen plenty of testing every time a popular MoE comes out of people testing with that override to various values, but are you sure that is recommended? LLM performance tends to drop if you activate more or less than experts than the trained upon amount.

E.g., for DeepSeek-Lite, 8 instead of 6 active experts is distinctly better for `IQ1_S` and `IQ1_M`. IIRC, 3 instead of 2 active experts did improve `IQ1_S` and `IQ1_M` quantized Mixtral8x7.
