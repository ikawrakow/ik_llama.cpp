## 📄 Description

Recently there's been some discussion (and I've also experimented slightly) around adding chat tokens to the imatrix dataset and tokenizing them, a change from the default behaviour, so I was curious why the original implementation avoided tokenizing them

Was it just an arbitrary decision or was there a reason at the time?

When the `imatrix` tool was written handling of chat, special tokens, etc., was extremely immature/non-existent in `llama.cpp` . If you look at the `llama_tokenize` function in `common` that is being used by the `imatrix` tool to tokenize the calibration data, you will see that the `parse_special` argument was added well after the `imatrix` tool was merged. It was added with a default value of `false`, so that defined the `imatrix` tool behavior with special tokens as this argument is missing in the `imatrix` call to `::lama_tokenize`. By the time `llama_tokenize` got the ability to parse special tokens I had left the `llama.cpp` project, so somebody else needed to notice, investigate, and possibly change.

Back then I had the concept that the calibration data for chat/instruction tuned models need to contain actual instruction tuning datasets. And, instead of blindly dividing the calibration data into chunks of `n_ctx` tokens, the chunks needed to be individual request-response pieces (or series of related request-response chunks in a conversation). But then everybody became an expert on `imatrix` calibration data, people started using the `imatrix` tool the way it is for chat models and it seemed to work OK, so I never followed up.

In any case, it would be interesting to see if including special tokens, using non equal-size chunks, etc., in the `imatrix` calibration data would improve the quality of quantized models.

@bartowski1182 I see you submitted [this PR](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13389) in mainline.

You are welcome.

Was planning to open one up in each assuming it made sense, it seems like a nice idea for A/B testing anyways, but figured I'd double check with the original architect that there wasn't something glaringly obvious I was missing

After they have independently discovered it, or when enough time has passed, I'll make the change here, and at that point I can also put in the ability to use special tokens. Do you hear complains from users about reduced model quality after the MLA change?
