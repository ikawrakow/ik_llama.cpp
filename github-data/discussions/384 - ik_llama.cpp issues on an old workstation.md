## 📄 Description

Hi! So I have managed to get ubergarm's 235B quant to work on a 6 year old workstation with 2*2080TI's, 64GB RAM and a pretty fast (new) SSD. 

I have encountered some wierd issues with trying to use multiple GPUs though:

- Just using one device and offloading all experts to CPU works.
- The problems start when I try to keep some MoE experts on GPUs...
- Trying to use 2 devices with -sm layer and putting the first few layers entirely on GPU results in a crash on load where for some reason CUDA tries to allocate 170GB of VRAM:

```
llama_new_context_with_model: n_ctx      = 8192
llama_new_context_with_model: n_batch    = 2048
llama_new_context_with_model: n_ubatch   = 512
llama_new_context_with_model: flash_attn = 1
llama_new_context_with_model: mla_attn   = 0
llama_new_context_with_model: attn_max_b = 0
llama_new_context_with_model: fused_moe  = 1
llama_new_context_with_model: ser        = -1, 0
llama_new_context_with_model: freq_base  = 1000000.0
llama_new_context_with_model: freq_scale = 1
llama_kv_cache_init:      CUDA0 KV buffer size =   768.00 MiB
llama_kv_cache_init:      CUDA1 KV buffer size =   736.00 MiB
llama_new_context_with_model: KV self size  = 1504.00 MiB, K (f16):  752.00 MiB, V (f16):  752.00 MiB
llama_new_context_with_model:  CUDA_Host  output buffer size =     1.16 MiB
llama_new_context_with_model: pipeline parallelism enabled (n_copies=4)
ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_type_alloc_buffer: allocating 167771.94 MiB on device 0: cudaMalloc failed: out of memory
ggml_gallocr_reserve_n: failed to allocate CUDA0 buffer of size 175921630208
llama_new_context_with_model: failed to allocate compute buffers
```

- Trying to use -sm row results either in illegal memory access if I specifically pin some expert weights to CUDA1, or the ``GGML_ASSERT(!ggml_backend_buffer_is_cuda_split(src0_1->buffer) && "mul_mat_id does not support split buffers")`` error if I do not. Incidentally I think the last one is because split buffers and 3d tensors are not supported by llama.cpp.

Command used (some variation of):

```
build/bin/llama-server -m ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--ubergarm--Qwen3-235B-A22B-GGUF/snapshots/073738969f80d41f288cbfd6a29523769336bee8/Qwen3-235B-A22B-mix-IQ3_K-00001-of-00003.gguf -ngl 99 --temp 0.6 --top-k 20 --top-p 0.95 --min-p 0 --presence-penalty 1.5 -c 8192 -ot "^blk\.[0-2]\.=CUDA1" -ot "^blk\.[3-9]\.ffn_.*_exps\.=CPU" -ot "[1-9][0-9]\.ffn_.*_exps\.=CPU" --host 127.0.0.1 --port 4000 -fa -fmoe -sm row -mg 0 -v
```

Am I just doing something wrong or is there some genuine bug here?

Split mode "row" does not work for MoE models (and I'm not sure if it works for dense models as I don't have access to a multi-GPU system, so have not tested since forking). I'm pretty sure split mode "row" does not work for MoE models in mainline `llama.cpp` either.

With two or more GPU's you may need a more complicated tensor override recipe to get the best possible performance out of the system. For two identical GPU's I think you could start by using
```
-ngl 99 -ot exps=CPU -ts 50,50
```
note how much VRAM this has used on each GPU, and then change to e.g.
```
-ngl 99 -ts 50,50 -ot "blk\.[0-1]\.ffn=CUDA0,blk\.[2-3]\.ffn=CUDA1,exps=CPU
```
(I'm just guessing, as I don't have access to a multi-GPU system).

Note that the tensor overrides are processed in the order they were defined on the command line. So, in the above example, we don't need to be specific about experts tensor layers going to the CPU because the ones that we want to stay on the GPU (layers 0,1 on CUDA0, layers 2,3 on CUDA1) were already handled, so all remaining experts go to the CPU.

If the GPUs are different, then it may be better to just manually define with `-ot` which tensors go where.

> First I'm  not sure where this came from but a lot of folks keep using `-ot "^blk\.[3-9]\.ffn_.*_exps\.=CPU"` which misses some other ffn layers without the `exps` as the naming convention on Qwen3 is a bit different than DeepSeek for example.

> Thanks @ubergarm ! For some reason ``-DGGML_SCHED_MAX_COPIES=1`` works and it no longer tries allocating 170GB of VRAM. I'm getting ~15 tok/s PP and ~6 tok/s generation. Not too bad really for a very old computer offloading from SSD! Specs: i9-9940X, 64GB quad channel ram, 2*2080Ti. I also offloaded all the ffn tensors as suggested.

> 
> @matt23654 I'm curious what happens if you add `-rtr` to your command line. Model loading will take longer, but possibly this will improve your PP performance (PP being only 2.5 times faster than TG does not sound right).

> 
> @ikawrakow So there definitely looks to be something a bit wierd going on, maybe because of the SSD, but ``-rtr`` didn't really change PP speed. I've also tried compiling with OpenBLAS, but that somehow seems to have made it slower (yay!).
> 
> The CPU is less active during PP than during regular inference, so I can only assume that somehow the SSD is bottlenecking it. The SSD bandwidth on its own should only be about 0.5tok/s peak, I think the reason generation is so fast is that Qwen isn't choosing experts uniformly and so the kernel caching is making it far closer to the quad-channel ram speed instead. That's my theory, anyway.

> *EDIT*: I removed `-rtr` because you don't have enough RAM to use that as it disables mmap. You can look into doing the offline tensor repack of the weights not offloaded to GPU so you can get the benefits of the repacked `_R4` and also mmap() to run despite only 64GB RAM.
