#### Description

Main motivation was to see how it performs for quantized kv-cache. Disappointingly, it is slightly worse than `Q8_0` for K-cache and `IQ4_NL` for V-cache (this `Q8_0`+`IQ4_NL` combo needs the exact same memory as `Q6_0` for both caches).

Nevertheless, with a block size of 32 it is the same as the other legacy quants, beets `Q5_0` and `Q5_1` with a significant margin for PPL (it is almost as good as `Q6_K`), performance on Metal is quite a bit better than `Q5_0` and `Q5_1`, etc. So that, once I did the work to implement and test, why not add it?

You should test the combo -ctk q6_0 -ctv q5_0.
After a few PPL tests, it seems to be a keeper for me, to replace q5_1 - q5_0 and be quite close to the K q8_0 mixes in term of quality with much less VRAM occupation.
