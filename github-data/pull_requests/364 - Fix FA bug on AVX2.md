## ðŸ“„ Description

The bug was quite subtle: we have `Q8_0` K-cache, so we need to quantize the `Q` tensor to the appropriate quantization type (`vec_dot_type` in `ggml` lingo) that differs from platform to platform. We pick correctly the type. But then we notice that it is a GQA case, so we repack  the K tensor to `Q8_0_R8` for faster processing, but still use the `vec_dot_type` selected based on `K` being `Q8_0`. On `Zen4` and `ARM_NEON` the `vet_dot_type` is the same, so everything works fine. But on `AVX2` the `vec_dot_type` changes, and we get gibberish (or even an assert for a NaN value). 

The bug was introduced in my recent CPU FA optimization round ([#351](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/351)) 

Closes [#363](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/363)

It looks like this does not fully fix [#363](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/363), but I'll merge it to not have 2 real bugs stay on the main branch.
