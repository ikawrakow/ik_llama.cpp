## ðŸ“„ Description

`Q4_0` repacked with 4 interleaved rows as `IQ4_NL_X4` (see PR [#118](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/118)).

PP-512 for LLaMA-3.1-8B for `ARM_NEON` (M2-Max), `Zen4` (Ryzen-7950X) and `AVX2` (Risen-5975WX):

| Platform |  Threads | Q4_0 | Q4_0_R4 | Speedup |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ARM_NEON |  8 |   84.57 Â± 0.94 | 115.79 Â± 0.86 | 1.369 |
| Zen4            | 16 | 185.89 Â± 0.84 | 278.15 Â± 0.39 | 1.496 |
| AVX2.          | 32 | 190.73 Â± 0.39 | 251.00 Â± 0.51 | 1.316 |

On `Zen4` `Q4_0_R4` is now the prompt processing champion.

Here the hand-written assembly for `Q4_0_4_4` in mainline `llama.cpp` achieves 122.8 t/s on my M2-Max, so beats `Q4_0_R4` by a small margin. My guess is that `Q4_0_4_4` is slightly better because there the `0x88` xor mask (which converts the unsigned 4-bit quants to signed 4-bit quants shifted 4 bits to the left) is already applied. But this trick is only useful for the `ARM` instruction set, and is absolutely not useful on `x86_64`, so I did not use it.
