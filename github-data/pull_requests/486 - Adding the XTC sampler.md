## ðŸ“„ Description

Given popular demand, here is the XTC sampler.

Same usage as in mainline:
* `x` to add with `--sampling-seq`
* `xtc` to add with `--samplers`
* `--xtc-probability` to set the probability
* `--xtc-threshold` to set the threshold

1.0 is disabled for threshold, not 0.0

> Yeah, I forgot and only remembered after commenting (after reading the rest of the commit). I was referencing mainline which makes the mistake of saying 1.0 here (but >0.5 in other places). Sorry.

minor typo here "threashold" should be "threshold"
