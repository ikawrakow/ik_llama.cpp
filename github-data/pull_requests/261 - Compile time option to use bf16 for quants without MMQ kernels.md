#### Description

The `IQ2_KS, IQ2_K, ..., IQ6_K` quantization types do not have MMQ kernels, so matrix multiplications for model weights quantized with these types are done via dequantization to `fp16` and `cublasGemmEx` GEMM using `fp16` precision. For the DeepSeek series of MoE models this leads to NaNs.

Ideally I should add MMQ kernels for these quantization types. But for now, the PR provides a quick fix: dequantize to `bf16` and use `bf16` cuBLAS GEMM. This is added as a compile time option enabled via
```
cmake -DGGML_CUDA_IQK_FORCE_BF16 $other_cmake_options
```
(or, if you like me prefer using `ccmake`, after pulling the PR, `cmake .. && ccmake .`, and then set the `GGML_CUDA_IQK_FORCE_BF16` to `ON`). 

I have tested with DeepSeek-Lite quantized with `IQ4_KSS` and `IQ4_K`. In both cases I get NaNs when running `perplexity` on the main branch. Turning on the `GGML_CUDA_IQK_FORCE_BF16` option provided by this PR results in meaningful PPL values.

@davidsyoung This should solve the issues with the `IQ4_KSS` DeepSeek-R1 model you created.

Awesome! Will re-quant over night and test tomorrow!

In case you still have the old quants, you can just use those with the new code you don't have to make new quants.

Unfortunately I don’t! My cache drive is limited so I tend to delete pretty soon.
