## ðŸ“„ Description

Low-bit quants often benefit from a fudge factor applied to the (super-)block scale. When I was developing `IQ2_K` and `IQ3_K` it was faster to change the fudge factor in `ggml-cuda/convert.cu` and recompile than to change it in the quantization function and re-quantize. But when I was ready, I forgot to move the `IQ2_K` and `IQ3_K` fudge factors to quantization, so they remained in the CUDA dequantization function (and hence weren't applied anywhere else). This PR fixes this.
