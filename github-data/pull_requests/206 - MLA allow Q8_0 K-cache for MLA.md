## ðŸ“„ Description

After PR [#205](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/205) we have two KV caches left when using MLA:
* `kv_l` - contiguous, not transposed
* `kvt_l` - a transposed version of `kv_l`

`kv_l` can be quantized, and this PR adds the necessary changes.
`kvl_t`, being a transposed version of `kv_l`, cannot be quantized. It can be eliminated by setting `MLA_USE_TRANSPOSED_CACHE` to 0 in `llama.cpp` (but then `kv_l` cannot be quantized as making a contiguous transposed tensor out of a quantized tensor as needed during inference does not work at this point).

Apart from reducing required KV cache memory, a quantized `kv_l` cache can also slightly improve TG performance after a long prompt. Here is a comparison between the main branch and this PR for `tg64@ppN` for different prompt lengths `N`. Model is `IQ4_XS` quantized DeepSeek-Lite. The results for the main branch are for `fp16` `kv_l` and `kvt_l` cache, the PR used `Q8_0` for `kv_l` and `bf16` for `kvt_l` (using `bf16` only makes sense for a CPU with native support, such as the Ryzen-7950X used to run the benchmark)
