## ðŸ“„ Description

@ikawrakow 

This PR contains the following things
- A fairydreaming commit that is supposed to increase PP
- Avoid allocating the MHA KV cache in MLA mode
- Adds a change I originally missed that is used for gguf-py.

I will follow up with:
- Having all the MoE experts load during warmup, that can be placed in this PR if you want, or a separate one. It is a very large QoL feature for large MoE. Without it the model is slowly loaded in on use, with it, the model is loaded immediately and at a faster rate.
- The mmap based KV cache buffer, it is functional but I have yet to make it a CLI option.

Looks good. I added a minor change to check if `wk_b` and `wv_b` are available before turning on MLA (so we don't crash if someone is using an old model and asked for MLA).

PP-4096 for `Q8_0_R8` quantized DeepSeek-Lite with `-mla` goes up to 292 t/s from 275 t/s with this change.
