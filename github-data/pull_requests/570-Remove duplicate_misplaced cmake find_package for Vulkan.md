#### Description

This line `find_package(Vulkan COMPONENTS glslc REQUIRED)` prevented to build anything on MSVS 2022 if the package was not present on the system, this even if Vulkan was not selected.

It's already present in the Vulkan conditionality.

```
if (GGML_VULKAN)
find_package(Vulkan COMPONENTS glslc REQUIRED)
```
