#### Description

It is a bit of a hack as I didn't see a good way to figure out if tensors may be uploaded to a GPU later on. But if running on the CPU it works fine. Just use
```
-rtr or --run-time-repack
```
and all tensors types that have a corresponding type with interleaved rows will be repacked. 

**Note**: turning on run time repacking will automatically turn off `mmap`.
