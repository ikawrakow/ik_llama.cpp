## ðŸ“„ Description

Among the useful stuff on mainline, there's the updates of gguf-split.

I encountered some crashes on my KCPP fork reading the split ggufs made with IK Llama back in January. I thus merged these two commits in my IK_Llama fork to produce my split ggufs, and the crashes were gone in my KCPP fork. I kept using this ever since.

Those two commits are pre-GGUF v14 refactor, and there was not a single conflict with the merge, nor problem to compile on the current IK_LLama.

So I just put it here!
