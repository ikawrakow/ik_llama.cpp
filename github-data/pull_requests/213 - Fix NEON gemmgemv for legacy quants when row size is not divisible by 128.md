## ðŸ“„ Description

I have broken it quite a while ago when I changed the NEON implementation to do two rows at a time. I haven't noticed as all models I typically use have row sizes that are multiple of 128. But as I was working on the `IQ1_S` NEON implementation for PR [#212](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/212), I was testing with DeepSeek-Lite (where K cache row size is 576, so not divisible by 128), using `Q8_0` for K cache (but no FA, where it works), and was getting NaNs or gibberish. I lost so much time until I finally realized that the issue is with the K cache `Q8_0` matrix multiplication rather than my `IQ1_S` implementation.

This PR fixes this.
