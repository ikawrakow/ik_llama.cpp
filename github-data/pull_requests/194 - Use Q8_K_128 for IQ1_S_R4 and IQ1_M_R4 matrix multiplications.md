## ðŸ“„ Description

@saood06 is still observing NaNs for DeepSeek-R1 quantized with `IQ1_S_R4`. As I don't see what else could be wrong, I'm making the following hypothesis:

1. Given the discussions about DeepSeek-R1 becoming "dumb" when `fp16` is used for some of the attention tensors, I hypothesize that there are activations that go beyond the range of `fp16` floats, which get truncated when converted from `fp32` for `fp16` for multiplications with some `fp16` model tensor.
2. If this is the case, using `Q8_1` as quantization type for activations, as `IQ1_S_R4` does, can be futile:
  * Suppose there is some block of 32 activations that has a maximum $x_{\rm max} > {\rm f16}_{\rm max}$
  * Suppose that the block scale $d = x_{\rm max}/127$ is in the `f16`  range. This is likely to be the case as `Q8_0` attention tensors are reported to behave better than `fp16`.
  * In `Q8_1` we also compute $s = d \sum q_i$, where $q_i$ are the 8-bit quants. The scaled sum $s$ is also stored as `fp16`. If one gets unlucky, it can overflow, despite $d$ being in range
  * If this occurs, we will get a completely bogus result for the `IQ1_S_R4` dot product with this block. To make the calculation more efficient on `AVX2`, we use ternary quants $0, 1, 2$ (instead of $-1, 0, 1$) to multiply the Q8 quants (so we can use `_mm256_maddubs_epi16`) , and then recover the correct result by subtracting $s$ from the result. But if $s$ is wrong (truncated because outside the `fp16` range), this does not work and we get a wrong result.
 
To test this hypothesis, this draft PR uses `Q8_K_128` for `IQ1_S_R4` and `IQ1_M_R4` matrix multiplications. `Q8_K_128` is a new 8-bit  quantization type similar to `Q8_K` but with blocks of 128 (so I can test with DeepSeek-Lite). It is draft because I haven't done the `ARM_NEON` implementation. `Q8_K_128` uses a 32-bit float scale, and the sums over blocks of 32 are stored as `int16_t` without multiplying with $d$, hence we cannot run into 16-bit float range issues. Perplexity for DeepSeek-Lite is slightly lower compared to using `Q8_1`, which indicates that there may be non-fatal truncation effects also there (normally one expects a slightly higher accuracy from using `Q8_0` or `Q8_1` because of the smaller block size).

Would appreciate if this gets tested with DeepSeek-R1.

No more `NaN`'s, nice! It's impressive how quickly you found the race condition and this issue.

Thank you for this! The decisive hint to solve it was the discussion about DeepSeek-R1 being dumb with `fp16` attention tensors that you alerted me to.
