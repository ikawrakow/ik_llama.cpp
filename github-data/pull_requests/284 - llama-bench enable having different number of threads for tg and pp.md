## ðŸ“„ Description

All applications in the `examples` folder except `llama-bench` accept `-t` (to specify number of threads for token generation) and `-tb` (to specify number of threads for prompt processing, a.k.a. prefill) as command line arguments. This is handy  because often TG peak performance is reached at a lower number of threads, so one wants to use that instead  of the number of cores, which is good for maximum prompt processing speed. `llama-bench`, inherited from upstream, has its own command line argument parsing, where one only has available `-t` but not `-tb`.

This PR adds a new command line argument to `llama-bench`: `-tgb` (or `--threads-gen-batch`).  One can use it as, e.g.,
```
./bin/llama-bench -tgb 4,16 -p 512 -n 128 other_arguments
```
where 4 threads will be used for the `tg128` test, and 16 threads will be used for the `pp512` test. For tests that are a combination of prefill and gen (`-pg`, `-gp`), the batch number of threads will be used for prefill, and the gen number of threads will be used for token generation. One can also specify multiple pairs of `{t_gen, t_batch}` for the `-tgb` argument, separating them with a semicolon. E.g.,
```
./bin/llama-bench -tgb 2,16;4,16;8,32
```

The `-t` argument continues to work as before. It adds a pair of the same integer in the list of `{t_hen, t_batch}` number of thread pairs. 

**Caveat:** For `-p` the batch number of threads is added to the table. For all other tests the gen number of threads is printed. This is of course appropriate for `-n` and `-gp`, but it becomes confusing for `-pg`, where the batch and gen number of threads both matter for the reported performance.  I guess, it would be better to print both thread numbers in this case, but this is not done in this PR.

Thanks for this one, should help optimize the big xeon 6980P given previous testing suggests that pp likes more threads than tg.
