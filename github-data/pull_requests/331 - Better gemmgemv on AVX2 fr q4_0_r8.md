## ðŸ“„ Description

I constantly get confused how many `int16_t` dot products (`_mm256_maddubs_epi16()` results) I can sum up as `int16_t` before overflowing. In the case of `Q4_0` I was adding too few, and was having one unnecessary `_mm256_madd_epi16` because of that.  This PR fixes this. The result is a ~10% gain in performance when tested with Geema-3-12B-Instruct.
