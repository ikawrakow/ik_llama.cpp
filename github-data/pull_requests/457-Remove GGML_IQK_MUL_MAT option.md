There is actually a point to leave this as a legacy marking for the quants, because it helps a lot with merging your quants, including the potential future ones, which are still compatible with only a few formatting adaptation with the mainline ggml framework, even if the ops are not.

I'm really good at shooting in my own foot! :D
