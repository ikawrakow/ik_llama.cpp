Just saw what looks like a small patch in mainline's [earlier ggml-org/llama.cpp[#13438](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/13438) just updated in [#13469](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/13469) (linked here)](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13469)

Could be related to my issue with `DDDD` showing up for longer contexts which I attributed to `-ser` [as we were discussing here](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/386#issuecomment-2869078136)?

Though hrmm, yours has this in a similar area already, so may not be relevent.
```
      if (np > 1) {
          __syncthreads();
      }
```

fwiw I tested the following small change and still am seeing `DDDD` with longer context and `-ser` so might not be related.

Thanks for the alert.  But isn't it easier to rerun without `-ser` to not have 2 potential causes at the same time? There has been [a new report](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/385#discussioncomment-13125043) about SER not working, this time CPU only.
