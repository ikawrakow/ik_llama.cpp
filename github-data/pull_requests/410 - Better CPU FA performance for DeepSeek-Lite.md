## ðŸ“„ Description

This FA tweak improves DeepSeek-Lite CPU TG performance with `Q8_0` KV cache.

Not sure if it will have a positive impact for the large DeepSeek models. To optimize the FA strategy for those I need to be able to test, which I cannot atm.

The graph shows a comparison between the main branch and this PR for a `Q4_0` quantized DeepSeek-Lite model. The CPU is Ryzen-7950X. The x-axis is `N_KV/1000`, where `N__KV` is the number of tokens in the K cache, which is quantized with `Q8_0`. The `sweep-bench` command was
```
./bin/llama-sweep-bench -m $model -c 16384 -ub 1024 -t 16 -mla 3 -fmoe -fa -rtr
```

I did end up doing a fresh build, drop cache and server launch and have used it up to 32K tokens (double where I normally test sweep-bench), and my informal results are that it is about the same, maybe a little better. I don't see the same large improvement that seems to scale with context size that you do.

I may run a full sweep-bench later to get a better comparison, I only ran it at very low amounts just to validate the model was warmed up and running at normal speeds ( I usually do this before launching server) and it performed about the same.

There is something different with the big siblings of DeepSeek-Lite that I haven't understood what it is.  For one, IIRC your TG performance drops 3X when you go to 16k tokens, while in my case it is still at ~60% even before the PR. The self-attention part per layer in DeepSeek-V3/R1 is 8X of DeepSeek-Lite (128 instead of 16 heads for otherwise identical tensor dimensions). The FFN part is about 7X (`7168 x 2048` vs `2048 x 1408` + 8 active experts instead of 6) per layer, so I don't really see a reason why it should behave differently. If anything, with `-mla 3 -fa` my expectation would be that the big model TG performance decreases less with context size as the K-cache is smaller relative to the amount of computations that need to get done. So, I guess, it is somehow related to NUMA, so it is bottle-necked on that when computing self-attention. If so, yes, you probably will not see (significant) performance improvement.

I'm not sure because it has good local hitrate on TG see this: https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/201#discussioncomment-13203928

The high local TG hit rate is measured at what context?
