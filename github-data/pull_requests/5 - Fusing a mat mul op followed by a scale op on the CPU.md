## 📄 Description

This is useful for Bitnet here we have almost all matrix multiplications be followed by scale operations.
As a result, we get a ~2% boost in Bitnet PP performance.

Implementation is easy when the matrix multiplication is done by `iqk_mul_mat`. But if `iqk_mul_mat` is not implemented for the quant type/architecture, we need to add the scaling to llamafile sgemm and to `ggml` itself, which is way more messy, so I didn't do it yet.

Given that Bitnet is just a niche thing for now, I'll just leave it on a draft PR for now.

I don't think I'll ever merge this.
