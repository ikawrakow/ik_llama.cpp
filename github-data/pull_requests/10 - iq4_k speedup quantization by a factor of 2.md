## ðŸ“„ Description

It is interesting to observe that `clang` produces code that is ~6X faster than the `GCC` result on a simple benchmark that measures the speed of the `best_index_iq4n` function (which is the bottleneck during `IQ4_K` quantization). But when this is used in practice in  `quantize_row_iq4_k_impl_bs16`, the `clang` executable is actually worse than the `GCC` executable. Either way, both compilers need a hand, so this PR gives it to them. This gives us a ~2X speedup in the `IQ4_K` quantization.
