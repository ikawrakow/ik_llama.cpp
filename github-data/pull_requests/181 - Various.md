## ðŸ“„ Description

PR started by me adding the `-gp` option to `llama-bench` as per https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/11126 because I wanted to test TG performance after a long prompt to be able to compare to the MLA attention implementation in  https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/11446.

But then I noticed that the repacked `Q8_0` and `Q4_0` quants do not work for row tensor sizes that are not a multiple of 128 (4 x block size of 32), which is the case for some of the tensors in Deepseek2-Lite that I used for testing, so I fixed that.

And than I was comparing performance after the fix on `Llama-3.2-1B`, and noticed that FA with `Q8_0` K-cache does not work.  `Llama-3.2-1B` has a head size of 64 and there was a comment in the code that `Q8_0` does not work for a head sizes less than 128, so I fixed that as well.
