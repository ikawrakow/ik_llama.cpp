## 📄 Description

After a very long bug hunt, this PR should hopefully fix [#389](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/389), [#398](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/398), [#425](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/425).

Thanks to everybody who tested my previous bug fix attempts!
Huge kudos to @ciprianveg who was instrumental in finding the bug!

The bug was in the CUDA matrix-vector multiplication kernel (a.k.a., MMVQ). It only shows up when the kernel processes 2 or 3 tokens. Hence, it was not observed during TG, and only showed up during PP when an expert in a MoE model ended up with having to process just 2 or 3 tokens from the batch (which is rare).

I believe all other changes I made in [#442](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/442) are not necessary, but please test this PR to confirm.

Closes [#389](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/389) 
Closes [#398](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/398)
Closes [#425](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/425)

I think I'll merge this now. It fixes a real bug, so it should be merged irrespective of it fixing [#389](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/389), [#398](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/398), [#425](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/425).
