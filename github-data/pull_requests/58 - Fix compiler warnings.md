## ðŸ“„ Description

I got tired of the "ISO C++ forbids anonymous structures" warnings that are due to the way the quants scales are defined in `ggml-common.h`, so fixing it with this PR. 

Once at it
* Also added `-Wno-c99-extensions` when building on APPLE to avoid the gazillion warnings I'm getting due to `arm_neon.h`.
* Fixed the warnings in `iqk_quantize.cpp` and added `GGML_ABORT` when an implementation is missing.
