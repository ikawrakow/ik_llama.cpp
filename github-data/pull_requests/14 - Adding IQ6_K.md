## ðŸ“„ Description

This PR

* Adds `IQ6_K` - see [#8](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/8) for motivation
* Fixes the Zen4 implementation of `IQ3_K`, `IQ4_K` and `IQ5_K`

### New IQ6_K

The graph below is a copy of the graph in [#8](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/8) with the quantization error of the new `IQ6_K` non-linear quantization type added (cyan circle near 6.6 bpw).  We observe a significant improvement compared to `Q6_K` (0.4% vs 0.65%). LLaMA-3.1-8B quantization error is better too (0.15% vs 0.26%), so I think this is a worthwhile addition.

### Fixing the Zen4 implementation of `IQ3_K`, `IQ4_K` and `IQ5_K`

While working on `IQ6_K`, I have noticed that there is a problem with the Zen4 implementation of the `IQ3,4,5_K` quants. I was using the standard k-quants matrix multiplication template (`mul_mat_qX_K_q8_K_AVX512`). On Zen4, this template uses the `_mm512_dpbusd_epi32` instruction to perform the dot product between the quants of the left matrix and the `Q8_K` quants of the right matrix, which produces a SIMD vector containing 32-bit integer results. But for k-quants these 32-bit integers fall within `int16_t` range, so they get packed to 16-bit and are then multiplied with the block scales. But for the 3+ bit non-linear quants, the `_mm512_dpbusd_epi32` may go outside of the `int16_t` range, which then leads to truncation and a wrong result. I have now corrected the implementation. This results in a small performance regression. The table below shows a performance comparison for LLaMA-3.1-8B between the original Zen4 implementation and the corrected Zen4 implementation for `IQ3_K` on a Ryzen-7950X  (using 16 threads for PP-512 and 4 threads for TG-128)
