#### Description

@ubergarm This is specifically for your 9950X CPU.

On my 7950X this is ~10% slower than what we have on the main branch. The 7950X supports `AVX512`, but 512-bit instructions get executed as two 256-bit instructions. Hence, I'm expecting (hoping?) this `Q8_K_R8` GEMM version to be significantly faster on a CPU with "real" 512-bit instructions such as the 9950X.

Please benchmark it so I can decide if it is worth adding this to the main branch.
