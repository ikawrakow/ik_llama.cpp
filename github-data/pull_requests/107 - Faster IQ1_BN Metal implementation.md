## ðŸ“„ Description

On my 30-core M2-Max TG-128 for Bitnet-1.58b-3.3B improves from 82 t/s to 94.7 t/s.
PP-512 goes from 686 t/s to 702 t/s.

Integer multiplications are expensive, so the trick used is to replace them with shifts and additions.

There is also a minor `IQ2_BN` PP-512 improvement (710 -> 714 t/s).
