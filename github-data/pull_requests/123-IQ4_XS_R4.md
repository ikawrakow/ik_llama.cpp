#### Description

Follow up of #118, #119, #120, #121, #122 for `IQ4_XS`.

I was curious to see if one can make the interleaved rows strategy work for i- and k-quants with their super-blocks & blocks and two levels of scales. `IQ4_XS` seemed easiest, so I tackled that one first. We get a massive speedup on `ARM_NEON` and a more modest (but still significant) gain on `AVX2/Zen4`. I'm not 100% happy with the `Zen4` implementation, but shuffling scale bits for 4 rows at once is tricky, so for now I have settled on a sub-optimal solution.  

Anyway, here is `PP-512` for LLaMA-3.1-8B on `Zen4` (Ryzen-7950X), `ARM_NEON` (M2-Max) and `AVX2` (Ryzen-5975WX)
