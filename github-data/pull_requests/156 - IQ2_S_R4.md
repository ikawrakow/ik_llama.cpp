## ðŸ“„ Description

Sub-4 bpw i-quants have a terrible CPU performance, so I was curious to see if we can improve by interleaving rows.

This PR adds `IQ2_S_R4`, a 4-row interleaved version of `IQ2_S`.

We get very modest performance gains. I guess, the combination of loading data from a  large table, blocks of 16 quants, and perhaps me not having found the optimum bit packing kills the performance. 

Anyway, here is `PP-512` for LLaMA-3.1-8B on `Zen4` (Ryzen-7950X), `ARM_NEON` (M2-Max) and `AVX2` (Ryzen-5975WX)

| Platform |  Threads | IQ2_S | IQ2_S_R4 | Speedup |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ARM_NEON |  8 |  44.68 Â± 0.20  | 50.40 Â± 0.18  | 1.128 |
| Zen4            | 16 | 117.47 Â± 0.47 | 148.51 Â± 0.51  | 1.264 |
| AVX2           | 32 | 150.92 Â± 0.25  |  177.59 Â± 0.40  | 1.177 |

We get some performance gains for TG as well, especially on `AVX2`.
Here results for TG-128 on LLaMA-3.1-8B with different numbers of threads:
