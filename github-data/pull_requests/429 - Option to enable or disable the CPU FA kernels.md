## ðŸ“„ Description

The compilation of `iqk_mul_mat.cpp` takes extremely long - currently 2m22s on my Ryzen-7950X CPU, with some users reporting times in the range of 30 minutes on an Antroid phone using Termux . This is to a large extent due to the Flash Attention (FA) kernels. Hence, this PR adds a `cmake` option to enable or disable the CPU FA kernels. It is set on by default, and can be changed using
```
cmake -DGGML_IQK_FLASH_ATTENTION=OFF ...
```
Setting it to off reduces compilation time of `iqk_mul_mat.cpp` to 25 seconds on the Ryzen-7950 CPU, so a speedup of 5.7X. Hopefully this will make it easier to build `ik_llama.cpp` on an Android phone.

If `GGML_IQK_FLASH_ATTENTION` is set to `OFF`, FA is still available but will be computed using the `ggml` implementation, which is very slow on any CPU I have tried.
