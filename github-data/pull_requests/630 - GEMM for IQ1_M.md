#### Description

Closes #626 

Hopefully the collective knowledge on Reddit and elsewhere that one cannot use `-fmoe` because of the missing `IQ1_M` GEMM has not already been perpetuated for all eternity...

After this PR, you can use `-fmoe` for any model.

Oh, no `ARM_NEON` for now, this will come later.
