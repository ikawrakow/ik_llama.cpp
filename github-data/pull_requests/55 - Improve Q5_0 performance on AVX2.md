## 📄 Description

The main purpose of the [previous PR](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/54) was to try to improve `K*Q` matrix multiplications for flash attention with `Q8_0` quantized k-cache. Sadly, the performance improvement that we got for `Q8_0` did not translate into better FA performance. It is a rainy Saturday, so need something to brighten my day. The last PR is very easily applied to `Q5_0`, so here we are.

The table shows performance comparison to mainline `llama.cpp` for LLaMA-3.1-8B ona Ryzen-7950X
