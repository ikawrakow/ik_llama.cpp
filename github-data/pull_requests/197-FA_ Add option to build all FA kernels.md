#### Description

Similar to the CUDA situation.
It is OFF by default.
If OFF, only `F16, Q8_0, Q6_0`, and, if the CPU provides native `BF16` support, `BF16` CPU FA kernels will be included.
To enable all,
```
cmake -DGGML_IQK_FA_ALL_QUANTS=1 ...
```

This cuts compilation time for `iqk_mul_mat.cpp` by almost half (45 seconds vs 81 seconds on my Ryzen-7950X).
This is poor men's solution of the long build time until #183 is tackled.
