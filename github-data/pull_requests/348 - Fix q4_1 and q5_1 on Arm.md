## ðŸ“„ Description

When I changed the `vet_dot_type` for `q8_1_x4` to `q8_2_x4` for the quants using `q8_1_x4` I forgot to also make the change for the `ARM_NEON` implementation. As a result `q4_1` and `q5_1` are currently broken. But because `q4_0/q5_0` will use `q4_1/q5_1` for a few `ffn_down` layers, `q4_0` and `q5_0` are broken as well.

Looking at the implementation, changing to use `q8_2_x4` would be too a major change. Hence, just go back to using `q8_1_x4` on Arm. If this results in some models not working correctly, then simply don't use legacy quants for those models.
