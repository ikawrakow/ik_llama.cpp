#### Description

On the CPU I get the exact same PPL with and without FA using `bf16` for kv-cache. But on CUDA the `bf16` kv-cache result is about the same as the `fp16` kv-cache CPU result, so I'm missing some conversion somewhere. Either way, we can now run on all platforms supported here with `bf16` kv-cache.
