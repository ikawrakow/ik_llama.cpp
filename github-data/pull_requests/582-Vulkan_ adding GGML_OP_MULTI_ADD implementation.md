#### Description

This is relevant for MoE models. The performance improvement is surprisingly small. Somewhere it was mentioned that Vulkan kernel launch overhead is significantly larger than CUDA, so I would have expected a more significant performance benefit. For DeepSeek-Lite, the number of graph nodes in `ik_llama.cpp` with this PR is 1420 vs 1871 in mainline `llama.cpp`.

But, if nothing else, this removes  the last Vulkan special-casing when building the compute graph.
