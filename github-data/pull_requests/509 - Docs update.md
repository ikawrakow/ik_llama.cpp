If I update the `Latest News` section of the main README.md can I omit dates and bundle things together (multiple PR's linked per line)?

Sure. Maybe a good idea anyway as one doesn't want the "News" section to become a novel.

Can I update the bundle the old ones too? It would be nice if it just highlighted all the latest information. Sections based on model support, quant types, performance, features, etc. With all linked PR's (which have dates on hover so that information is still available).

Yes, that would be good too.
But maybe we can keep a copy in the Wiki as a record of how things evolved.

Can you create that entry of the Wiki (and maybe put in the new stuff)?

This would also now be a good time to deprecate MLA-2 and do this: https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/473#discussion_r2116235243

That way people can learn see the old stuff, but this only shows stuff but labels them under improvements for fast and mem.

Just commenting here to remind myself to add to `examples/server/README.md` a section instructing people on how to access the legacy UI, and also documentation for the new endpoint [#502](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/502).
