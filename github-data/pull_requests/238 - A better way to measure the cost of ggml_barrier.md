## ðŸ“„ Description

Trying to measure it on each `ggml_barrier` invocation is too imprecise as the best time resolution we have in `ggml` is 1 us. Hence, measure the total graph execution time and and the sum of the node execution times. The difference is then the cost of thread synchronization via `ggml_barrier`.

Using this on TG runs with DeepSeek-Lite I'm finding that `ggml_barrier` costs about 7% of the graph evaluation time when running on the CPU.

I like cooking. Well, at least this kind of cooking. Real cooking I tend to avoid by going to restaurants.
