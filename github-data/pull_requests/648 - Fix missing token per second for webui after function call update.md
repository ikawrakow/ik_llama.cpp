LGTM.

Tested and see the t/s measurements which was missing when testing main.

@firecoperana 

Just to let you know the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) says to "Squash-merge PRs", you created a merge commit, which is different. I know that document was created from mainline and hasn't been touched here, but it does seem that squash merge commits are the norm here as well.
