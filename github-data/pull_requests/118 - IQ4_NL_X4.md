#### Description

In mainline `llama.cpp` they have added various types where `Q4_0` or `IQ4_NL` are repacked by interleaving quants from 4 or 8 consecutive rows. They get significant improvement in prompt processing speed on `ARM`, so I decided to see if interleaved rows can further improve the `iqk_mul_mat` matrix-matrix multiplication speed.

This PR adds `IQ4_NL_X4`, a repacked variant of `IQ4_NL`.  The table below shows `PP-512`comparison between `IQ4_NL` and `IQ4_NL_X4` for LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct on `ARM` (M2-Max), `Zen4` (Ryzen-7950X) and `AVX2` (Ryzen-5975WX). Somewhat surprisingly the speedup on Zen4 is larger than the speedup on M2-Max. On `Zen4` `IQ4_NL_X4` is now the fastest quantization type for prompt processing, beating even `bf16` (237 t/s on the Ryzen-7950X CPU, which has native `bf16` support).   

| Platform |  Threads | IQ4_NL | IQ4_NL_X4 | Speedup |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ARM_NEON |  8 |   85.11 ± 0.47 | 110.32  ± 0.53 | 1.296 |
| Zen4            | 16 | 168.21 ± 0.60 | 262.69 ± 0.65 | 1.562 |
| AVX2.          | 32 | 186.81 ± 0.17 | 231.45 ± 0.61 | 1.240 |

For reference:  On my M2-Max mainline `llama.cpp` (build: `3420909d`) achieves 92.3 t/s for `IQ4_NL_4_4`.
