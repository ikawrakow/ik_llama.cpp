## ðŸ“„ Description

`ffn_down_exps` row sizes are not a multiple of 256 in DeepSeek-Lite. When using `--pure` with `llama-quantize` this leads to a crash. I got tired of having to do custom quantization overrides in that case, so this PR adds the check for divisibility by the quantization block size also for `--pure`, and uses the fallback quantization type if necessary.
