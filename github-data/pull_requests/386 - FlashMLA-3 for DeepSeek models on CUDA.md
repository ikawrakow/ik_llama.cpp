## 📄 Description

[This PR](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/13306) in mainline `llama.cpp` is a CUDA flash attention (FA) implementation that also works with K head size of 576 and V head size of 512 as required for DeepSeek models with MLA enabled. **Caveat: it only works on Ampere or newer Nvidia GPUs**.

I have taken it and adapted it to the `ik_llama.cpp` environment, but only using it for the 576,512 case (for other head sizes it is slower than the existing implementation). This allows to finally have `-mla 3 -fa`, which is the recommended option for DeepSeek models when running on the CPU, also work on CUDA.

This results in massive DeepSeek TG performance gains for long contexts when self attention is computed on the GPU. The graph below shows an example for `Q4_0` quantized DeepSeek-Lite model that I can fully load on my RTX-4080 GPU with 16 GB VRAM. I have used u-batches of 4096 with `sweep-bench` to more quickly cover the context range of up to 65k tokens. The main branch results use `-mla 2 -fa`, the PR uses `-mla 3 -fa`. No FA (which is what happens for TG when `mla = 2`) is slightly faster with zero context. I have considered special-casing `N_KV <= 256` , but than decided against it. Less than 256 tokens in the KV cache has no relevance in actual usage other than bragging about the great performance one got on Reddit and elsewhere after saying 'Hello' to the LLM and checking the performance stats. At 60k tokens the PR is 3X faster than the main branch for TG!

I'm not including a comparison to the mainline PR as it has not been merged, so things can change (but for the curious, mainline TG is slightly faster for small `N_KV` and slower for large `N_KV`, PP continues to be far behind `ik_llama.cpp`).

The PR also adds a tweak to matrix-vector multiplications that leads to minor TG performance gains for MoE models other than DeepSeek. As an example, the next graph shows TG performance for `IQ2_XS` quantized Qwen3-30B-A3B (so it fully loads on my 16 GB GPU) using  `-fmoe -fa -ub 2048`.

Testing with DeepSeek-V3/R1 will be greatly appreciated. Very few can run these models fully offloaded to the GPU, but I do expect non-negligible performance gains for long context also for hybrid GPU/CPU inference (where self attention is computed on the GPU). Checking that it works correctly is of course most important.

Will `-mla 3 -fa` work in mixed cpu+multigpu setup with Amperes and Pascals? Or it would be better to continue use `-mla 2 -fa`? I mean, maybe `-mla 3 -fa` will use some fallback for old cards and it would still be better than `-mla 2 -fa`

> Will -mla 3 -fa work in mixed cpu+multigpu setup with Amperes and Pascals?

If all attention calculations are done on the Ampere cards, it could work.
There is no fallback, and I'm not sure if I have put enough checks to prevent eventually hitting an assert if it attempts to run the 576,512 head size combination on a Pascal card.

MLA 3 has faster sweep bench speeds for me but unfortunately deepseek 2.5 goes aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

MLA 2 works.

👤 **ubergarm** commented on **2025-05-08** at **02:09:57**

I gave this a very quick try though the model doesn't fit in VRAM+RAM so pulls almost 6GB/s paging of a Gen5 PCIe NVME drive. This is a 3090TI FE 24GB VRAM GPU.

## tl;dr;
Something seems off with the response using `-mla 3` but still works how I'd expect for `-mla 2`. I didn't do the sweep's far enough at as it takes too long on this rig.

👤 **ikawrakow** commented on **2025-05-08** at **04:34:09**

OK, thanks for testing. Here is what I get with DeepSeek-Lite for @ubergarm's quantions:
```
<think>
Okay, so I need to count from 1 to 10 in French. Let me start by recalling what I know. I remember that French numbers are different from English, so I need to be careful. Let me think... I think "1" is "un" in French. Then "2" is "deux". Wait, is that right? I'm not sure. Maybe I should check. But since I can't look it up right now, I have to rely on my memory.

For "3", I think it's "trois". Yes, that sounds familiar. "4" is "quatre", right? Then "5" is "cinq". Hmm, I'm not sure about "cinq" but I think that's correct. "6" is "six", "7" is "sept", "8" is "huit", "9" is "neuf", and "10" is "dix". Wait, is that all? Let me go through each one again to make sure.

Starting over: 1 - un, 2 - deux, 3 - trois, 4 - quatre, 5 - cinq, 6 - six, 7 - sept, 8 - huit, 9 - neuf, 10 - dix. That seems right. I think that's correct. I don't remember any exceptions here. But maybe I should double-check the spelling. For example, "quatre" is spelled with a "c" and an "a", right? Yes, "quatre". "Cinq" is spelled with a "c" and "i" and "n" and "q"? Wait, no. "Cinq" is spelled c-i-n-q? Wait, no, it's c-i-n-q? Wait, no, "cinq" is c-i-n-q? Wait, no, it's c-i-n-q? Wait, no, it's "cinq" which is c-i-n-q. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. The word is "cinq", so c-i-n-q? Wait, no, it's spelled c-i-n-q? Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct spelling is c-i-n-q? No, it's "cinq" which is c-i-n-q? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm confusing it with "cinq" which is spelled c-i-n-q. Wait, no, the correct spelling is c-i-n-q? No, "cinq" is spelled with a "c", then "i", "n", "q"? No, that's not right. Wait, "cinq" is actually spelled with a "c", "i", "n", "q"? No, that's not correct. Wait, "cinq" is spelled c-i-n-q? No, I think it's c-i-n-q. Wait, no. Let me think. The word "cinq" is spelled c-i-n-q? No, that's not correct. I think it's spelled c-i-n-q. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just go with what I remember. I think "cinq" is correct. So I'll stick with that. 

Another thing: in French, numbers after 16 are sometimes different, but for 1-10, it's straightforward. So I think the list is correct. Let me just write them out again: 1 un, 2 deux, 3 trois, 4 quatre, 5 cinq, 6 six, 7 sept, 8 huit, 9 neuf, 10 dix. Yes, that seems right. I think that's accurate. I don't recall any mistakes here. So I'll present that as the answer.
</think>

Here is the count from 1 to 10 in French:

1. **un**  
2. **deux**  
3. **trois**  
4. **quatre**  
5. **cinq**  
6. **six**  
7. **sept**  
8. **huit**  
9. **neuf**  
10. **dix**  

Let me know if you'd like to practice further! 😊 
```

The difference is that Lite has 16 heads, while the big models have 128. So, I guess, something is not quite right with more than 16 heads.

👤 **ikawrakow** commented on **2025-05-08** at **07:29:24**

To be honest, I don't understand the failure.

**Recap `mla` options**
* `mla = 1`
   - Head sizes 576,512
   - This is what is done in mainline `llama.cpp`
   - FA did not work on CUDA prior to this PR and PR 13306 in mainline
* `mla = 2`
  - For prompt processing uses `attn_wkv_b` to convert the cache to head sizes 192,128 -> FA on CUDA works
  - For TG FA is disabled
* `mla = 3`
  - Prompt processing as in `mla = 2`
  - TG as `mla = 1`. FA on CUDA is possible after this PR
 
**Observations**
* According to @Panchovix who has tested mainline PR 13306 with a large DeepSeek model it works. Hence, the 576,512 kernel should be working
* According to @Ph0rk0z and @ubergarm `mla = 2` works. Hence we can conclude that the 192,128 kernel used for prompt processing also works
* When running CPU-only, `mla = 3, fa = 1` works. Hence, data handling and such should be fine.

So, based on observations, when we use 192,128 CUDA kernel for PP and 576,512 CUDA kernel for TG, it should be working. But it doesn't.

How many heads does 2.5 have? Maybe there is some difference. It's easier to run and more like qwen in size. I will have to check the MLA 1 output, could be bug in FA. Also had some crash in MLA 2 after using it a while but haven't reproduced yet.

Should be the same as V3 with 128 heads.

> It's easier to run and more like qwen in size. 

I know. But the DeepSeek models are the only MLA models around. I have verified it works with DeepSeek-Lite (16B parameters, 16 heads). The next step up with MLA are the giant DeepSeek models that I cannot run myself.

👤 **Ph0rk0z** commented on **2025-05-08** at **14:22:22**

Looks like my theory was correct. On my system MLA 1 also produces issues, probably as soon as FA kicks in. May start out coherent for the first bit of tokens and then descends intooooooooooooooooooosddkkkkkkkkasd

I can test on ikllamacpp in some hours if I can replicate on deepseek v3 0324 (I'm not home right now)

On main llamacpp I tested up to 64K CTX and it was working fine with the PR. If I understand correctly I have to use the latest quants and then use -mla 3 -fa? Main llamacpp uses -mla 2 -fa equivalent?

The mainline `llama.cpp` MLA implementation corresponds to `-mla 1` here. With this it wasn't possible to use flash attention on CUDA in the past, and it became possible with this PR and PR 13306 in mainline. If you use the latest quants that enable MLA in mainline, you require the not yet merged PR [#394](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/394) that enables support for these incompatible models. Otherwise, you need to use an older model that does not allow MLA in mainline `llama.cpp`.

👤 **Ph0rk0z** commented on **2025-05-08** at **14:53:50**

I have no v3/r1 quants yet so it may very well work there but not in 2.5.

`-mla 1 -fa` uses the same 576,512 CUDA kernel for prompt processing and for token generation. If the issue is with this kernel, then yes, `mla = 1` will also not work.

Then the conclusion would be that I introduced a bug when porting the mainline PR adding the 576,512 kernel. But it does work with DeepSeek-Lite, so I'm not sure how to debug.

I can probably download deepseek lite since it's small. This is what I'm running: https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-V2.5-1210-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-V2.5-1210-IQ4_XS

@Panchovix You are using a GGUF made for mainline llama.cpp MLA. As I wrote above, you need PR [#394](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/394), which is an attempt to fix the incompatibility.

@ikawrakow ah I'm dumb, thanks! Haha gonna try the PR.

Ok.. baby deepseek v2.0-chat, the ~16b one, right? Sort of inconclusive results.

MLA 1 - oooooooooooooooooooooooooo
MLA 2/3 crash with 8bit cache https://pastebin.com/0mkrcZwE

MLA 2/3 + FP16 cache do not exhibit too many issues from a quick test.

These quants are months and months old so I'm not sure if anything is wrong with them, I also used IQ4_XS

re-ran v2.5 without 8bit cache and mla3 works now.

I just tested [this model](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/DeepSeek-V2.5-1210-GGUF/tree/main/DeepSeek-V2.5-1210-IQ3_XXS), which is near the maximum size I can go. Seems to work perfectly fine with `fp16` KV cache:
```

> Tell me everything you know about radiation therapy of cancer
Radiation therapy, also known as radiotherapy, is a medical treatment that uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Here's an overview of everything you need to know about radiation therapy for cancer:

### Types of Radiation Therapy

1. **External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT)**
   - **Conventional Radiation Therapy**: Delivered in daily fractions over several weeks.
   - **Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)**: Uses advanced technology to deliver precise radiation doses to the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
   - **3D Conformal Radiation Therapy**: Delivers radiation in 3D to match the shape of the tumor.
   - **Proton Therapy**: Uses protons instead of X-rays to deliver radiation, which can be more precise and reduce side effects.

2. **Internal Radiation Therapy (Brachytherapy)**
   - **Permanent Seed Implantation**: Radioactive seeds are placed directly into or near the tumor.
   - **High-Dose-Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy**: Temporary implants that deliver a high dose of radiation over a short period.

3. **Systemic Radiation Therapy**
   - Involves giving radioactive materials (such as radioactive iodine) that travel throughout the body to target cancer cells.

### Indications

Radiation therapy is used to treat a wide range of cancers, including:
- Brain tumors
- Breast cancer
- Cervical cancer
- Lung cancer
- Prostate cancer
- Lymphomas
- Head and neck cancers

### Purpose

- **Curative Intent**: To eliminate cancer cells and potentially cure the patient.
- **Palliative**: To relieve symptoms and improve quality of life by shrinking tumors that cause pain, pressure, or other issues.
- **Adjuvant**: Given after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells.
- **Neoadjuvant**: Given before surgery to shrink tumors, making surgery easier and potentially reducing the need for extensive procedures.

### Side Effects

- **Acute Side Effects**: Temporary and usually resolve after treatment. Examples include skin reactions (like a sunburn), fatigue, and temporary hair loss.
- **Late Side Effects**: Can occur months or years after treatment. Examples include radiation fibrosis, second cancers, and damage to nearby organs.

### Planning and Simulation

- **CT Scan**: Used to create a detailed map of the tumor and surrounding tissues.
- **Simulation**: The patient is placed in the exact position they will be in during treatment to ensure accuracy.
- **Immobilization Devices**: Used to keep the patient still during treatment.
- **Planning**: A team of specialists, including radiation oncologists, medical physicists, and dosimetrists, plan the treatment to deliver the most effective dose with minimal side effects.

### Delivery

- **Linear Accelerator**: The machine used to deliver external beam radiation.
- **Treatment Sessions**: Typically delivered 5 days a week for several weeks, allowing normal cells time to recover.

### Advantages

- Highly effective for many types of cancer.
- Non-invasive (for external beam therapy).

> Can you solve the following system of equations for me? x + y = 2 x - y = 3
Certainly! Let's solve the system of equations step by step.

We have:
1. \( x + y = 2 \)
2. \( x - y = 3 \)

### Step 1: Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \)
\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 2 + 3
\]
\[
2x = 5
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
\[
x = \frac{5}{2}
\]

### Step 3: Substitute \( x = \frac{5}{2} \) into one of the original equations to find \( y \)
Using the first equation:
\[
\frac{5}{2} + y = 2
\]
\[
y = 2 - \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
x = \frac{5}{2}, \quad y = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

> Can you explain the German electoral system?
Certainly! The German electoral system is a mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) system, which combines elements of both direct representation and proportional representation. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Overview

1. **Federal Elections in Germany**:
   - Elect the members of the Bundestag (Federal Parliament).
   - There are two types of seats in the Bundestag: direct mandates (first-past-the-post) and party list seats (proportional representation).

2. **Direct Mandates**:
   - Voters cast two votes: one for a candidate in their constituency (Wahlkreis) and one for a party list.
   - The first vote determines the direct mandate. The candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins a seat directly.

3. **Party List Seats**:
   - The second vote determines the overall share of seats each party gets in the Bundestag.
   - If a party wins more direct mandates than its share of the second votes would allow, it keeps those extra seats (overhang seats).

### Key Features

1. **Majority Bonus (Überhangmandate)**:
   - If a party wins more direct mandates than its share of the party list votes, it keeps those extra seats. This can lead to more seats than the total number of second votes.

2. **Compensatory Seats**:
   - To ensure proportionality, compensatory seats are added to the Bundestag to balance the overhang seats.

3. **Threshold for Representation**:
   - A party must receive at least 5% of the second votes or win at least three direct mandates to enter the Bundestag. This rule prevents very small parties from gaining representation.

### Election Process

1. **Constituency Candidates**:
   - Each voter casts a vote for a candidate in their constituency. The candidate with the most votes wins a direct mandate.

2. **Party Lists**:
   - Each party prepares a list of candidates for the entire country. Voters cast a second vote for a party list.

3. **Seat Allocation**:
   - After the votes are counted, the Bundestag determines the total number of seats each party gets based on the second votes.
   - Direct mandates are allocated first. If a party has more direct mandates than its share of the second votes, it keeps those extra seats (overhang seats).
   - Compensatory seats are then added to ensure proportional representation.

### Example

Suppose there are 100 seats in the Bundestag and the following results:
- Party A wins 40 direct mandates and receives 35% of the second votes.
- Party B wins 25 direct mandates and receives 30% of the second votes.
- Party C wins 10 direct mandates and receives 15% of the second votes.
- Party D wins 5 direct mandates and receives 20% of the second votes.

After allocating direct mandates, Party A has 40 seats, Party B has 25 seats, Party C has 10 seats, and Party D has 5 seats. However, Party A should only have 35 seats based on its share of the second votes. To compensate, compensatory seats are added, bringing the total number of seats to 100, ensuring proportional representation.

### Conclusion

The German electoral system ensures a balance between the direct representation of candidates and the proportional representation of parties. It allows for a more representative parliament while maintaining a connection between voters and their representatives at the local level.

Yes this seems to work in my quick testing of big DeepSeek-R1-IQ2_K_R4 hybrid CPU+GPU on my local rig for both `-mla 2` and `-mla 3` e.g.
```
      -ctk q8_0 \
      -mla 3 -fa \
      -amb 512 \
      -fmoe \
      --n-gpu-layers 63 \
      --override-tensor exps=CPU \
```

However, I noticed for both `-mla 2` and `-mla 3` in combination with `-ser 6,1`, it seems to work okay for short prompts like `Count from 1 to 10 in French`, but for longer ~600 token prompts it will throw `DDDDDDDD` again. Not a priority, I only use `-ser` if I'm desperate and can't access a remote rig!

Thanks for working through all the combinations!

👤 **ikawrakow** commented on **2025-05-09** at **16:19:29**

Thanks for testing.

I'm not sure if the `DDDDDD` is an actual bug. It is a low bit quantization, and then on top 6 instead of 8 experts. I would be worried that it is a bug if you hadn't used `-ser`.

I've never gotten `-ser` to work for me when loading a long context session (but I haven't really tried it in any other situation). I've never opened an issue as I've never taken the time to produce a minimally reproducible example.

I just tried out PR404 which is now `main@a2d24c97`, but still seeing it reply `DDDDD` for longer contexts when using `-ser 6,1`.

It could be this model is too small, all attention layers are Q8_0 for GPU, and for CPU ffn_down is IQ3_K_R4, ffn_(gate|up) are IQ2_K_R4.

Still works okay without `-ser 6,1`. I also tried removing `-fa` when testing ser and also threw DDDD.

*EDIT*
I did a couple more tests and `-ser 6,1` seems to work with about ~200 token prompt, but it breaks and replies with DDDDDDD at ~300 tokens context prompt.

Deepseek 2.5 seems to work with q_8, tg/pp is slightly faster than F16. Unfortunately sometimes a GPU gets stuck at 100% in task manager and the bench or server halts then sits. GPU power draw not consistent with 100% usage of course. It could be due to my undervolting or something else? F16 sweep completes successfully and is definitely "heavier" on resources so I'm not sure anymore.

OK, thanks. The PR fixes things for me, but it seems there is still a bug lurking somewhere. I'll keep looking.

There have been reports about problems with FA also in mainline. As I took the DeepSeek implementation from there, I guess `ik_llama.cpp` has the same issues. Your observation of the calculation being stuck indicates a synchronization problem, likely with the async copies that are now being used in the middle of the kernel.

👤 **Ph0rk0z** commented on **2025-05-10** at **21:14:52**

Now that you mention it, that's the kind of error I'd get on llama-server. It would eventually fail and segfault there with synchronization listed as the fault. I assumed it was due to me undervolting. Setting lower max gpu clock along with the clock offset (only way to do it on linux) caused it to happen less often. 

Perhaps it's only coincidental. Haven't yet tested EXL2 tensor parallel and it's much higher GPU load on the same settings. If it dumps on me again, I'll try to grab the error.
