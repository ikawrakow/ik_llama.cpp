#### Description

I have been putting all matrix multiplication (GEMM) and flash attention (FA) kernels into `iqk_mul_mat.cpp`. With time it became a giant source file (~18 kLOC) containing heavily templated C++ code. The result: extremely long compilations times (over 2 minutes on a high end CPU, with some users reporting 30 minutes on an Android phone).

This PR splits `iqk_mul_mat.cpp` into multiple files:
* `iqk/iqk_gemm_floats.cpp` - contains GEMM kernels operating on float tensors
* `iqk/iqk_gemm_1bit.cpp` - contains GEMM kernels for BitNet and `IQ1_S, IQ1_M` (along with repacked variants)
* `iqk/iqk_gemm_kquants.cpp` - contains GEMM kernels for k-quants and repacked k-quants
* `iqk/iqk_gemm_iquants.cpp` - contains GEMM kernels for i-quants and repacked i-quants
* `iqk/iqk_gemm_iqk_quants.cpp` - GEMM kernels for `IQX_K` and repacked
* `iqk/iqk_gemm_legacy_quants.cpp` - GEMM kenels for legacy quants (`Q4_0`, etc.) and repacked
* `iqk/iqk_mul_mat.cpp` now contains just the GEMM business logic and compiles very fast
* `iqk/fa/iqk_fa_templates.h` - FA templates that get included in the FA `*.cpp` files
* `iqk/fa/iqk_fa_*_*.cpp` - FA template instantiations for specific combinations of K and V attention head sizes

With this, a fresh build with of the `iqk` folder (with files compiled in parallel) takes
* ~17 seconds on a Ryzen-7950X (Zen4)
* ~15 seconds on a Ryzen-5975WX (AVX2)
* ~13 seconds on a M2-Max (ARM_NEON)

The Zen4 build is longer because we have additional kernels for `bf16` not supported natively by the other two platforms.
The GEMM files compile in 5-6 seconds each, so the FA instantiations dominate the build time. One could split them further, but for now I can live with compile times in the range of 15 seconds.

It is a massive change. Testing of all types (50+ when row-interleaved quants are included) on `AVX2, Zen4` and `ARM_NEON` took quite some time. I hope to have covered all possible combinations, but still would appreciate additional testing from people using `ik_llama.cpp` for CPU-only inference.

Closes #183

Testing the build time: ~7 min compared to ~18 minutes before on my dual socket Xeon E5-2690 v3. It used more threads but still nowhere near saturating my available ones for a large amount of the time. It may have a lower peak memory footprint but I will have to measure that better to tell.

Tested with my standard `cmake .. -DGGML_RPC=ON -DGGML_IQK_FA_ALL_QUANTS=1; cmake --build . --config Release -j 48`

>It cannot saturate your 48 cores. It needs to build libggml.so first, and this is what it takes to do that:

I know and I'm not expecting it to, but it still did have a much higher usage overall. (I use this machine to do a lot of cross-compiling and builds of other software so I understand what the output of cmake means and I was monitoring it alongside btop). 

>Compiling llama.cpp is another piece that takes quite some time, so it should get refactored as well.

That piece is fast enough on my machine iqk_mul_mat.cpp was the majority of the time spent before.

Thank you for this, it is a very welcome speed improvement.
