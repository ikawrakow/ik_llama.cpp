## ðŸ“„ Description

The Vulkan stuff had ended up outside the `if (GGML_VULKAN)` condition, which prevents building any configuration unless having Vulkan installed.

This PR fixes it.

Oh, it shows as 130 lines changed because I retabed (don't like having tabs in source code). The change is much smaller in reality.
