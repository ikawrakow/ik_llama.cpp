#### Description

Explicitly added only to files where I have done non-trivial changes since the last merge of mainline on August 12 2024.

If I understood correctly, I didn't need to do that because the copyright is established by the [LICENSE file](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/blob/main/LICENSE) in the project. But this doesn't seem to be widely known, so to avoid confusion, adding a copyright notice to files I have modified.

@saood06 As you are not listed as an author in the LICENSE file, you may want to add your own copyright notice to the files that you have contributed/modified.
