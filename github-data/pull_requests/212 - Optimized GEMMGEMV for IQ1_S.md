## ðŸ“„ Description

Apparently there are many people who would prefer to just run Unsloth's `IQ1_S` DeepSeek-R1 model as is instead of quantizing to `IQ1_S_R4` and taking advantage of the better model quality and improved inference speed.

So, here is a `iqk_mul_mat.cpp` implementation for `IQ1_S`.

I don't have the ability to run DeepSeek-R1, so using DeepSeek-Lite as a surrogate to test performance as it has the same architecture. The downside is that we don't test "pure" `IQ1_S` performance as various tensors that would have been quantized to `IQ1_S` get quantized to `IQ4_NL` due to their row sizes not being divisible by 256 (the `IQ1_S` block size). Performance tests are run on Ryzen-7950X (`Zen4`), Ryzen-5975WX (`AVX2`) and M2-Max CPU (`NEON`)

I think one can do better by interleaving 4 rows on the fly, but I leave this for another day.

ikawrakow, thank you so much. This helped me a lot!
Also, it's not that I'm reluctant to use it IQ1_S_R4ã€‚Instead, I need a smaller file size and memory (you said he would reduce it by a few GB), it's just that my current work requires running ready-made Unsloth's DeepSeek-R1.
As soon as I'm done with the job, I'll start doing my own quantification of the IQ1_S_R4 using your suggestion, and my device will test the R1 of the 671B very well and I'll tell you the results! I am 100% convinced that this new way(IQ1_S_R4) of quantizing will have better quality and speed!!
Thanks,again!
