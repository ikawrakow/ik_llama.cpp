## ðŸ“„ Description

This ports https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/9396 and https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/9117 (I don't think I needed this as the changes in here are basically reverted in 9396).

The issue was that the convert script used generate_extra_tensors for those tensors but there was no code that called that function.

I tested with [Llama-3_1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3_1-Nemotron-51B-Instruct) and it now generates the rope_freqs.weight which was missing previously.

Look at [#377](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/377) for more information.
