## ðŸ“„ Description

This PR further improves the Flash Attention implementation as follows:
* Slightly faster `V * softmax(K * Q)` implementation. This benefits all V-cache types
* Faster implementation when the K-cache is quantized with `Q8_0` via run-time-repacking to `Q8_0_R4`.

The following graph shows prompt processing speed as a function of prompt length for LLaMA-3.1-8B quantized with `IQ4_XS` on a Ryzem-7950X CPU. The PR results are shown with black (`BF16` KV-cache) and red (`Q8_0` KV-cache) triangles, circles are used for the main branch.  I have reused the graph from the last post in [#25](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/25) by just adding the results for this PR, so mainline `llama.cpp` performance is shown as well. I'm particularly pleased with the fact that `Q8_0` KV-cache is now on per or even slightly better than the natively supported 16-bit float type as `Q8_0` quantized KV-cache is basically lossless while reducing required memory by 2X.

For reference, with a `Q8_K_R8`-quantized model we achieve 380 t/s for 512 tokens, and 150 t/s for 32k tokens.

Here is the performance relative to a GPU (RTX-4080) for the above graph

![pp_gpu_vs_cpu1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b103b599-b4e6-4775-8c2a-b7fff69fe61c). We observe the ratio now decreasing with increasing prompt length $\Rightarrow$ the utilization of available FLOPs in the FA implementation is now better on the CPU compared to the GPU.
