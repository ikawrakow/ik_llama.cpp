#### Description

add quickstart section using ubergarm's discussion post. Scrolling to the discussion every time I want to remember how to build the damn thing is a minor inconvienience so this pull request is both useful and self-serving. Thanks <3

The quickstart section seems like a very oversimplified version of the `docs/build.md` file (which I just noticed should be updated to reference `ik_llama.cpp` not `llama.cpp`.

I do think a Quick Start section similar to mainline could be beneficial but I still think it should go after the News section (which still needs to be shorter), and reference `docs/build.md`.

`-DGGML_BLAS=OFF`

Is not needed, it is off by default.

> Why do I see the latest news as being changed in the diff?

i'm hiding the fact that this is a drive by pull request by making it extremely amateurish (read: i am not used to using the github webui and didn't know i could just edit the readme on the main branch and make a new branch from the edit)
