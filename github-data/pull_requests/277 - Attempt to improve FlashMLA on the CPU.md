## ðŸ“„ Description

@saood06 Can you try if this works better for your setup with `-mla 3 -fa`? Thanks.

There is a faster path for TG with FA and `mla=1,3`. But it only gets taken if some values are a multiple of the number of threads. This PR changes the implementation to also take the fast path when this is not the case. On a 32-core `AVX2` system I observe some speedup with 24 and 48 threads compared to main, so would be curious to know if this also improves things on a dual-socket system.

I'll test this with sweep-bench after the other 5 tests finish, as these tests take a long time and I won't be at my desk till tomorrow.

And also here's PP since it was generated anyway

It seems a bit better (not counting the dips), but also far less dippy.

Thank you for these results.

I'll look into the performance dips, but it is kind of tricky. When the work to be done is not evenly dividable between the threads, there will always be a slightly lower performance. But yes, I'm somewhat surprised that the performance dips are so large.
