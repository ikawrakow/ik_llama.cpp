## ðŸ“„ Description

With this change we get 104 t/s for Gemma-2-9b with a context of 8192 tokens on a Ryzen-7950X.

For this model and context size, about 10% of the time is spent in `softcap` (5.8%) and `soft_max` (4.2%) when running on the Ryzen-7950X CPU. I wonder if it wouldn't be better to merge `softcap` and `soft_max` into a single op (for Gemma-2, `softcap` in the attention layer is immediately followed by `soft_max`)
