## ðŸ“„ Description

This PR is a follow up to [#482](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/482), and applies the same dequantizing GEMM for MoE matrix multiplications.

For a DeepSeek-Lite model where only the `ffn_up` and `ffn_gate` tensors are quantized with `IQ2_KT` I observe a ~35% improvement in PP performance compared to te main branch.
