## 📄 Description

This quantization script is obtained by making a sort of "cross multiplication" with the python code for q5_0, and the C code for q5_0 and q6_0 in order to get through trial and error the code for the q6_0 conversion script, this with the help of a 7xB parameters AI model.

It was an interesting experiment!

Tested on Llama 3.2 instruct 1B and Qwen 2.5 instruct 1.5B.
Bitrate of this q6_0 conversion is 6.50BPW straight.
PPL equivalent (+/-0.5%) to a regular q6_0 quant from a fp16 gguf.
Inference is working as intended in my Croco.cpp.

This will set it to `Q6_0` also for `Q8_0` conversion?

> No, the q8_0 conversion ftype is not touched.
> This part of the code will just set the embeddings, output weight, attn_v, attn_k, or attn_qkv when it exists in ggml_type q6_0 instead of q8_0 for the conversions in ftypes q5_0 and q5_1.
