## ðŸ“„ Description

It looks like they have abandoned the Bitnet quants in PR-8151 in `llama.cpp` and are now going for quantization types in blocks of 256 similar to k- and i-quants. This of course removes support for 3B Bitnet (number of columns is not a multiple of 256) without clunky stuff such as padding, so they are going for [TriLM](https://huggingface.co/collections/SpectraSuite/trilms-unpacked-668d5f62afe0f4036925b1d2) instead, being excited about the newly added `TQ1_0` and `TQ2_0` quantizations, and `TQ2_0` being the fastest quant around on `AVX2`. So, I decided to check how it compares to the CPU implementation here.

The `IQ1_BN` and `IQ2_BN` quants in this repo rely on the tensors in the model converted to `GGUF`  being prepared as ternary, with separate tensors holding the scales. Instead of adding yet another hack to the `convert_hf_to_gguf.py` conversion script, for a quick comparison I added to the `Q2_K` quantization function a ternary net detection. If a ternary net is detected, the quants only take values `0, 1, 2`, all block scales and mins are set to one, and the super-block scale/min are set to the max value found in the row. But to be able to quantize to `Q2_K_S` without an imatrix, I also needed the ability to ignore the build-in imatrix rules, which I added to the `llama-quantize` tool and to `llama.cpp`. With these changes, a `Q2_K_S` quantization of the 3.9B TriLM model matches `fp16` perplexity (using `Q6_K` for `output.weight` and `Q4_K` for `token_embedding.weight`). It is actually even slightly better than `fp16`, I'm getting `PPL = 11.1531` for `fp16` and `PPL = 11.1240` for `Q2_K_S`.

We can now compare performance of `Q2_K_S` to the new `TQ_2` quantization in `llama.cp`. I'm using the 3.9B TriLM variant. The command line to quantize with this PR is
```
./bin/llama-quantize --pure --output-weight-type q6_K --token-embedding-type q4_K --ignore-imatrix-rules $trilm_model $output_file q2_K_S`
```

Here is what I find for `PR-8151` on my Ryzen-7950X CPU:

And here is what I get for `Q2_K_S` in this repo:

| model                          |       size |     params | backend    | threads |          test |              t/s |

So, despite wasting time for unnecessary block scale multiplications, we still outperform `TQ2_0` by 30% for prompt processing. Token generation is off course memory bound and, with the `Q2_K_S` quantized model being ~25% larger than `TQ2_0`, peak TG performance is ~15% lower.
