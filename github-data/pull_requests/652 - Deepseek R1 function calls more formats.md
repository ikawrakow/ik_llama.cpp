Implemented more DeepSeek R1 supported function tool calls formats.
The diff of `examples/server/function_calls.md` shows what formats are supported. 

I was testing DeepSeek R1 and I found out that it often uses different formats with Claude Code, so I decided to support them as well. It can be useful when next version of DeepSeek is released, so we will have better support than even original llama.cpp
