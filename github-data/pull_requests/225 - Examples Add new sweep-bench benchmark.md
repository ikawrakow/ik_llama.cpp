## ðŸ“„ Description

Port of https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/commit/9488fbf1e4334b8f189b38a7d224b8e6c1a7b22b

This is a good tool to benchmark with as requested by [#223](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/223). 

As a very quick demo I generated this, just by running this ( ```./llama-sweep-bench -c 2048 -ub 512 -m  WizardLM-2-8x22B-IQ4_K_R4.gguf -ctk q8_KV -ctv q8_0 -fa --output-format jsonl ``` and then sweep-bench-plot.py with the output).

@saood06 thanks I'm a convert to `llama-sweep-bench`! It is indeed very useful.

I pushed a branch on my personal mainline llama.cpp fork just to use for testing performance across forks. I don't plan to open a PR to mainline, but just left it up there in case anyone else is using it. I'm guessing ik has something similar as we were comparing the new GLM-4 performance. 

Thanks!
