## ðŸ“„ Description

To be consistent with the other quants interleaving 4 rows.

I started the interleaved rows experiment with `IQ4_NL` and named the packing `IQ4_NL_X4`. But then I thought that `_X4` is actually ambiguous. 4 times of what? We already have quants where 4 consecutive blocks are packed together into a larger "X4" block. Because of that I named all following interleaved rows quants using "_R4" (as in 4 rows). To be consistent with this naming convention this PR renames `IQ4_NL_X4` to `IQ4_NL_R4`.
