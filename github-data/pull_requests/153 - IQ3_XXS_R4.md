## ðŸ“„ Description

Sub-4 bpw i-quants have a terrible CPU performance, so I was curious to see if we can improve by interleaving rows.

This PR adds `IQ3_XXS_R4`, a 4-row interleaved version of `IQ3_XXS`.

We get decent performance gains, but still remain much slower than k- or legacy quants. I think there is still potential for optimization, but I was getting constantly confused about shuffling signs and scales, so at the end gave up with this result. 

Here is `PP-512` for LLaMA-3.1-8B on `Zen4` (Ryzen-7950X), `ARM_NEON` (M2-Max) and `AVX2` (Ryzen-5975WX)

| Platform |  Threads | IQ3_XXS | IQ3_XXS_R4 | Speedup |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| ARM_NEON |  8 |  48.18 Â± 0.69  | 67.45 Â± 0.78 | 1.400 |
| Zen4            | 16 | 107.42 Â± 0.33 | 141.62 Â± 0.30   | 1.318 |
| AVX2           | 32 | 142.38 Â± 0.48 |  184.42 Â± 0.26  | 1.295 |

We get decent performance gains for TG as well, especially on `AVX2`.
Here results for TG-128 on LLaMA-3.1-8B with different numbers of threads:

We now manage to saturate the available memory bandwidth on the Ryzen CPUs at 8 (Ryzen-7950X) or 16 (Ryzen-5975WX) threads, but are far from being memory bound on the M2-Max.
