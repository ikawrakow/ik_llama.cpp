## üìÑ Description

Attempt to fix [#398](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/398), [#425](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/425)

My hopes are not very high, but it is better to try.
* More extensive check that we can really also fuse the `ffn_down` operation. The change does nothing for me, but I also never have a crash, so let's try that.
* Picked up a few changes from the mainline `llama.cpp` back-end. None of the changes seems very promising, but let's still try.

Please let me know if this fixes the illegal memory access
