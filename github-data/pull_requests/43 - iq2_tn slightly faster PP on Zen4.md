## ðŸ“„ Description

With this change we get `PP512 = 494 t/s` (using flash attention), up from `468 t/s` (~5% improvement) running on a Ryzen-7950X CPU.

Compared to the initial `IQ2_TN` PR [#13](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/issues/13) the cumulative improvement is 15%.

Compared to `TQ2_0` in `llama.cpp`, which has now been merged, we are now 80% faster.
