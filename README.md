## Resources

There is no single point of reference describing all new `ik_llama.cpp` features. Pull requests often contain detailed information, so browsing the PRs is often the best way to learn about new features and how to use them. In addition
* [The Wiki page](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/wiki) has performance comparisons to mainline `llama.cpp`
* [This guide](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/258) is a good place to start if you came here because of DeepSeek models
* [This discussion](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/266) is about running DeepSeek-V3/R1 on a 16 x 3090 setup
* [This discussion](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/discussions/8) describes the new quantization types available in `ik_llama.cpp`

## Testing

### Function Calls Tests

To run the function calls test suite:

```bash
cd build
cmake --build . --target test-function-calls
./bin/test-function-calls
```

The test suite covers parser functionality, streaming, error handling, content cleaning, and server integration. All tests should pass to ensure production readiness.
