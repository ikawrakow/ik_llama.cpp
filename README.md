## TL;DR

This repository is a fork of [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) with better CPU and hybrid GPU/CPU performance, new SOTA quantization types, first-class Bitnet support, better DeepSeek performance via MLA, FlashMLA, fused MoE operations and tensor overrides for hybrid GPU/CPU inference, row-interleaved quant packing, etc.

## Latest News

* May 12 2025: User can now control if/which operations with tensors held in RAM are offloaded to the GPU. See [PR 405](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/405) 
* May 12 2025: Compatibility issues with mainline `llama.cpp` GGUFs for DeepSeek models with MLA enabled were resolved in [PR 394](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/394). The lower prompt processing performance resulting from using `llama.cpp`-style MLA GGUFs was recovered in [PR 409](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/409).
* May 11 2025: ðŸš€ Slightly faster flash attention for DeepSeek models on CUDA, along with extending compatibility to Touring or newer GPUs. See [PR 408](https://github.com/ikawrakow/ik_llama.cpp/pull/408)
